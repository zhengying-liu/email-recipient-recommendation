2297,2002-01-11 14:37:19,"Note:  Westpath Expansion plans filed at NEBTransCanada Plans Export Capacity Additions While it will take another two years for a Mackenzie Valley production and pipeline project to come together, there are signs that a safety margin is developing in Canadian natural gas supplies. Western Canada s established, heavily exploited gas fields can still deliver production growth for years to come, the National Energy Board has been told. TransCanada PipeLines Ltd. delivered the reassuring word in an application for a year-2002 expansion program dedicated primarily to increasing exports to California and the northwestern United States. TransCanada predicted that production from the western provinces can rise by about 15% to a sustained rate of 20 Bcf/d until at least 2010. Titled the Westpath Expansion, TransCanada s proposal calls for $48.3 million in new facilities to raise capacity on its British Columbia System by 420 MMcf/d or 16% to about 3 Bcf/d. The route crosses southeastern B.C. from the Alberta boundary to an export point on the U.S. border, where it fills PG&E Gas Transmission. Along with U.S. traders and power generators, customers lined up for the added service include Vancouver distributor BC Gas Utility Ltd. and Powerex Corp., a subsidiary of BC Hydro that procures fuel for gas-fired power stations. TransCanada told the NEB that it also expects to file a further expansion proposal in second-quarter 2002 for the B.C. System. The agenda matches growth under way on PG&E. TransCanada acknowledges that its forecast of supplies from the western provinces is more optimistic than the current expectations of the NEB, the Alberta Energy and Utilities Board and the Canadian Gas Potential Committee. The pipeline company said its information goes beyond official public records to include confidential data from customers, its own proprietary studies and updated information on results of last year s boom in gas drilling. The pipeline has told the NEB that ""with continued demand growth, the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin should be able to support increasing levels of gas deliveries of up to 20 Bcf/d at least through this decade."" Production from Alberta, B.C. and Saskatchewan averaged an estimated 17.2 Bcf/d in 2001. TransCanada also predicts that ""unconventional gas"" -- chiefly coalbed methane, and possibly reserves in ""tight"" or difficult geological formations -- will enter production by about 2006 and eventually reach 4 Bcf/d. But the pipeline projection acknowledges most tight gas ""is not currently considered economically available within the forecast horizon (to the year 2025) and current technological assumptions."" At the same time, TransCanada said there is also great uncertainty in predicting gas production from coal deposits because there is none yet in Canada. In the absence of a performance record to guide reserves and production projections, the pipeline says only that ""if research and development and economics lead to successful commercial operations, these sources may start contributing supply this decade."" In a separate toll case before the NEB, TransCanada predicts it will be 2008 before northern gas -- from either the Northwest Territories or Alaska -- begins to flow south. An announcement Jan. 14 by the Mackenzie Delta Producers Group and the Mackenzie Valley Aboriginal Pipeline Corp. suggested that TransCanada s educated guesswork is on the money. After nearly two years of preliminary feasibility studies and consultations with northern communities, the group -- Imperial Oil, Conoco Canada, Shell Canada and ExxonMobil Canada -- declared intentions to go ahead on a second planning stage. Next comes the ""project definition phase,"" or $200-$250 million in technical, environmental, commercial and consultation work required to make regulatory applications for field, gas-gathering and pipeline facilities. Conoco predicted the package will be completed and placed before Canadian authorities in 2003. The group says it intends to tap Arctic discoveries called Taglu, Parsons Lake and Niglintgak to send 1.2-1.5 Bcf/d south to northwestern Alberta. The plan calls for the gas to finish its trip to markets via spare capacity on TransCanada s system. TransCanada is in step with the group s expectations in suggesting it will take five years beyond 2003 to collect approvals and build the project. The pipeline company s forecast suggests northern production will arrive gradually, going from a starting rate at 500 MMcf/d in 2008 to 900 MMcf/d in  09, 1.1 Bcf/d in 2010, 1.2 Bcf/d in 2011 and 1.4 Bcf/d by 2012. The new forecast still does not predict which northern gas will flow, however. As a partner in the reborn Alaskan Northwest Natural Gas Transportation Co., TransCanada is teamed up with eight other companies to revive the Alaska Highway pipeline route worked out in the 1970s for production from Prudhoe Bay. In the documents before the NEB, TransCanada says it ""recognizes various uncertainties with respect to northern gas supply regarding economics, timing, routing and scope. It s unclear as to which pipeline will be successful in attracting northern gas."""

Jenny-----Original Message-----From: Mainzer, Elliot Sent: Monday, November 12, 2001 4:39 PMTo: Thome, JenniferSubject: RE: Potential green customersJenny, I think the first starting point is to look at our existing EES customer base and divide those customers into different categories according to their potential willingness to purchase green power, with IBM and Johnson and Johnson (members of the Green PowerMarket Development Group) being signature potential green customers. Richard can probably help you find this list. I think we should then look at the membership of several major organizations -- the Business Council on Sustainable Development, the Pew Center on Climate Change, Environmental Defense for starters, to find some other high-profile companies with a stated committment to environmental protection.  Jeff Shields will look at the large commercial and industrial customers targeted in Oregon as they are ENA, not EES target customers (Enron has an arbitrary SEC-code distinction for who ENA targets vs who EES targets and industrial customers are definitely ENA fodder). As for the other industrial accounts in other states, most of them are mines, aluminum smelters and that sort and are probably not our principal target audience. Thx, Elliot"

She indicated that RM is looking at the min. license fee number of $96K as the value to reimburse RM for the development costs of the CreditStream product.  I pointed out that we would be entitled to the $4800 revenue share from the one subscriber (as we discussed). She acknowledged that this was provided for under the agreement and realized that we had not provided for any consideration if RM had to reimburse all subscription fees to subscribers.  I also pointed out that we had no use for the CreditStream name and trademark application and no real value associated with it either, but that we would be willing to assign this to RM if they saw any use or value.  My thought on that is to simply recoup our legal costs in pursuing the application to this point - probably around $1,500 to $2,000.Helaine was going to speak to Alan about all of the above and get back to me.

19218,2001-11-27 17:20:20,"I think there is a real possibility here.  It would be extremely challenging commercially.How do we convince customers to participate?Two distinct areas:  (i) Existing portfolio of business and (ii) New business.New business is easier in one sense since everything is at the money, who would say no to a AAA credit?  Still requires significant amendment to existing trading documentation and where existing trades are present, separating them out as not netting with new trades.Existing business is easy for counterparties who are already in the money -- they will want the improved credit.  But how do we convince the out of the money side of the equation to participate?  This seem to me to be the biggest hurdle.Issues:Requires consent of customers and significant amendment of existing contracts.	Adequate incentive for customers currently out of the money to participate?	Might make more sense where no current positions exist.	Contract hurdles:	Need to allow for termination by defaulting party so Enron (VMAC) will be able to control termination on default.	Need the consent of counterparty to assign contract to VMAC.	May require changing permitted credit support from counterparties (letters of credit probably don t work).If we are attempting to put an existing book of business into the structure, an initial chunk of money will have to be given to VMAC to secure the existing out of the money side of the portfolio - how much is it and do we have that money?It s not clear how the proposal allows for credit lines to and from counterparties.  That is, if we have given an aggregate $200 million credit line to out of the money counterparties and have only been given an aggregate $100 million credit line to in the money counterparties, will VMAC be satisfied with the mismatch.  Will we continue to control the amount of credit we give to customers?  If we go to 100% collateral requirements for all participating transactions, this is solved since there can t be a mismatch.  (Will customers agree to 100% collateral requirements - i.e. no credit lines?)Once the supported/participating portfolio is out of the money, Enron will have to post collateral to VMAC.  If we fail, VMAC can default all participating/supported contracts.  When all of the contracts are terminated with Enron as the defaulting party, the payments to and from counterparties are calculated on their side of the market.  Presumably VMAC will require some cushion to cover this. "

I have had two discussions with her in the last 2 weeks regarding this.  She consistently does not take messages properly.  Most of the time all she tells us is the person s first name and that they are holding.  When she does get the last name it is incorrect at least half of the time.  She rarely gets the company name, and when she does it is incorrect or mispelled.The kitchen areas continue to be unkept and dirty.  She has started to put the dishes in the dishwasher but she rarely unloads them.  If she does it is after they have been in there for days.We continue to run out of office supplies and she does not consistently monitor the office needs.In summary, Heidi s performance has improved some since August 14 but that improvement is not seen on a consistent basis.  She has not elevated her performance to the level which is required to manage the office."

Do we have any interests that would warrant more than a plain intervention?  Let me know if you want a copy of the original filing, with maps, etc.INSIDE FERC-October 29, 2001WILLIAMS PUTS MEAT ON THE BONES OF WESTERN FRONTIER PROJECT DESIGNTouting a need for more pipeline capacity linking the ""prolific"" supply basins of the central Rockiesand increasingly hungry Mid-Continent markets, The Williams Cos. Inc. last week took the next step byfiling for authorization to build and operate the Western Frontier project.The sponsor has in hand four negotiated-rate deals for long-term service covering roughly two-thirdsof the 540,000 Dt/day of project design capacity, it told FERC in an Oct. 24 certificate application(CP02-11). Williams wants to have the $366 million project up and running by Nov. 1, 2003; itasked the commission to issue a final certificate by Dec. 11, 2002, so that it can commence constructionby the following April.Williams unveiled initial plans for Western Frontier early last summer (IF, 9 July, 14) and held an openseason in June and July. To carry gas from the Power River, Big Horn, Wind River and Green River basins- estimated to hold 173 Tcf of potential and recoverable reserves - the new 30-inch-diameter mainlinewould run 398 miles, starting at the Cheyenne Hub and ending at an interconnection with the system ofaffiliate Williams Gas Pipelines Central Inc. in Beaver County, Okla. Characterizing the Cheyenne Hub as""a liquid point of supply,"" Williams asserted that ""presently, supply capability to the hub has outpacedtransportation capacity away from the hub to market areas due to insufficient pipeline infrastructure.""Along the way, the Western Frontier mainline would make another interconnection with WilliamsCentral as well as with Northern Natural Gas Co., ANR Pipeline Co., Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of Americaand Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Co., ""thus providing multiple avenues for gas produced in the centralRockies to be transported throughout the Mid-Continent using the existing pipeline grid.""To ""further enhance its supply options,"" the sponsor wants to build a 9.7-mile lateral from themainline to the Wattenberg gas processing plant east of Denver to tap the Denver-Julesberg basin. Roundingout the project design are two new compressor stations, the 10,000-horsepower Chalk Bluff station tobe constructed at the Cheyenne Hub and the 20,000-hp Denver station to be built in Adams County, Colo.Following the open season, Williams hammered out precedent agreements with Marathon Oil Co.(75,000 Dt/day), Williams Energy Marketing and Trading Co. (200,000 Dt/day), Utilicorp United Inc.(15,000 Dt/day) and Entergy Power Generation Corp. (75,000 Dt/day). The initial term for the deals is 10years, except for Marathon which committed to a five-year term with an option to extend it an additionaltwo years, said the application.""Other shippers have expressed serious interest for the remaining capacity on Western Frontier, andactive negotiations are moving forward with these potential shippers,"" said the application, adding thatWilliams was ""confident . . . that the remaining capacity will be committed in the upcoming months.""With the addition of compression, the project could ""facilitate relatively inexpensive expansions toaccommodate future market growth,"" the sponsor told FERC. And that may well be necessary, it continued,pointing to ""stagnant to declining supply"" in the Mid-Continent basins coupled with ""projected demandincreases."" As in many areas of the country, ""much of the anticipated demand increase is attributed toinstallation and operation of . . . gas-fired electrical generation,"" it said. The 11,439 Mw of ""active wintergenerating capacity"" in the combined service areas of Western Frontier and Williams Central is expected tomore than double by 2004, said Williams.The application seeks negotiated rate authority for the project operator, Western Frontier PipelineCo. LLC, and approval of initial recourse rates. The maximum daily reservation rate under schedule FTSwould be 35?/Dt for contract demand in Zone 1 and 79.4?/Dt in Zone 2.Under the negotiated deals reached with the four ""anchor"" shippers, Utilicorp and Entergy would pay acombined reservation and commodity rate of 25?/Dt at a 100% load factor for Zone 1 service to theWilliams Central Hugoton station in Kansas, while WEM&T would pay a combined rate of 30?/Dt forZone 2 transportation to the Williams Central system in Oklahoma and Marathon would pay 32?/Dt underthe shorter contract for Zone 2 service to interconnects with ANR, Panhandle and Williams Central inOklahoma. All transportation would originate at the Cheyenne Hub."

28742,2001-11-26 09:16:21,"This is an alert that FERC will be more critical in the future of negotiated rate deals.  The orders discussed below dealt with buyout provisions in negotiated rate deals that Tennessee, ANR and Columbia had done.  These provisions had previously been permitted as negotiated rates, but FERC has decided that there is ""significant potential for undue discrimination"" and the recourse rates do not provide an adequate alternative.   Thus, anything in a negotiated rate deal that is not strictly rate-related will most likely be subject to intense scrutiny.FERC ADDS ANOTHER LAYER TO POLICY ON NEGOTIATED-RATE AUTHORITYActing on a series of contract-specific cases, FERC last week sharpened its policy on what is, and isnot, allowed under negotiated rates. In further defining its policy, the commission continued to leanheavily on the ""linchpin"" of negotiated-rate authority - that a customer not willing or able to negotiate adeal must always have the option of obtaining needed capacity under cost-based recourse rates.During discussion of the orders, Chairman Pat Wood III said it was ""important to keep in mind, as werush into the brave new world on the gas side,"" that ""all customers must be treated on a nondiscriminatorybasis by pipelines."" Last week s proclamation should be considered ""a reaffirmation of that nondiscriminatorytrend,"" he asserted.In representative language, the commission said it wants to ensure that parties ""are clear about contractingpractices that we find unacceptable because they present a significant potential for undue discrimination and thosethat we find acceptable because they can be permitted without substantial risk"" of such unequal treatment.FERC declared that a ""key factor"" in determining whether a negotiated provision is considered an""appropriate material deviation"" from a pipeline s filed tariff schedule is the extent to which recourse ratesprovide ""adequate alternatives"" to other shippers.In cases involving rates negotiated by ANR Pipeline Co. (GT01-25, RP99-301), Tennessee Gas PipelineCo. (RP96-312, et al.) and Columbia Gas Transmission Corp. (CP01-70), the commission ruled that thebuyout provisions are not allowed unless they are offered to all shippers as part of the pipelines  generallyavailable tariffs.The provisions at issue allow customers to buy out or terminate their contract demand levels prior tothe end of the deals. While the commission previously has held that such provisions can be included in anegotiated-rate package, ""we have reconsidered that holding"" because similar buyout opportunities arenot available to more traditional shippers operating under recourse rates, it said in the Tennessee order.Where a customer is seeking service for a set contract term and quantity, recourse service provides an""adequate alternative,"" the commission observed. ""However, if the customer desires a special contractdemand reduction or early termination right not provided in the generally applicable tariff, the availabilityof service at the recourse rate does not provide an adequate substitute, since recourse service would notinclude any such provision."" A shipper obtaining such a provision would be insulated from a certaindegree of risk, giving it ""an advantage over recourse-rate shippers,"" the commission pointed out.""A shipper s right to reduce, or terminate, its contract demand before the expiration of its contract is avaluable right, since it can enable the shipper to avoid significant liability for future reservation charges,""FERC said, adding that ""such a valuable right must be granted in a not unduly discriminatory manner.""Requiring pipelines to file generally applicable tariff provisions setting forth the conditions underwhich they will offer contract demand reduction rights ""is the best means of assuring that those rights willbe negotiated"" in a fair manner, FERC reasoned. Once approved, the tariff language ""will require thepipeline to grant similar rights to similarly situated customers.""Commissioner Linda Breathitt applauded the policy shift, characterizing it as a much-needed shot inthe arm for a program that had become ""muddled."" Through a ""tortured line of cases,"" FERC s definitionsof allowable contracting practices were ""obscured,"" Breathitt said in welcoming the new ""common-sense""approach. The ""tug of war"" that parties have engaged in over the past few years ""really hasn t served ourobjective of ensuring that nondiscriminatory rates and service"" are available to all shippers, she said."

We have a deal with FM Global to which it has agreed to by e-mail and which it has told us it would fund and has taken actions indicating that it would fund (i.e., calling Walton for permission to send the check to us, which Walton reportedly gave).  It has also explained that b/c of delays allegedly beyond its control, it could not make payment when originally expected, but will be doing so.  	Accordingly, in what I think is the very highly unlikely circumstance that FM for some reason does not fund the settlement, I think we should sue on the settlement deal, rather than say that because of the breach, we want to go back to the original claim.  I think the latter approach would be problematic, given the present financial circumstances.	Under the circumstances, I think it would be ridiculous for FM to try to take the position that because it had not funded a settlement to which it had agreed before the expiration of the suit-filing deadline, the insureds would be time-barred from pursuing FM.  I believe there is Texas caselaw that indicates that where an insured does not file suit because it is relying on the representations that the insured s claim would be settled, the insured is not time-barred from filing suit.	On Monday, in an abundance of caution, I would send something to Claude along these lines by e-mail, with a return receipt requested:	""Dear Claude:	As you are aware, today is the deadline for filing suit against FM under the current extension of time.  However, as we have compromised that claim with FM as set forth in the letter of [whenever we sent out the letter that the ENA officer signed] and as you have represented to us that FM will be forwarding the settlement funds of $1,375,000 by Friday, December 14[or whatever the date is], we will not be filing suit against FM.	Ron Tapscott""	The other option is to ask for an extension of time to file suit on the settlement, but again, I don t think we need to do that.	I will be in first thing Monday morning if you want to discuss further.  If anyone has a concern about this, please let me know immediately. 	Britt"

31740,2001-11-19 16:35:52,"	This will report on last Thursday s meeting of the joint defense group.  All the defendants were represented by either in-house or outside counsel.  Parenthetically, plaintiffs have still not served Enron Gas Marketing, Inc.  The only Enron defendants who have been served are Intratex and Enron Corp.  Parenthetically, again, all served defendants have been given an extension of time until December 5 to move, answer or otherwise plead.	The items discussed were as follows:	1.  Comment on the wording and time frame for filing three draft form pleadings prepared by F&J:  	a.  a motion to the plaintiff s counsel to show authority;	b.  a plea to the jurisdiction; and	c. an answer and affirmative answer.	2.  Whether the holding companies should file motions to transfer venue.	3.  Whether there should be a joint defense fund, with a formal joint defense agreement.	At the end of the discussion, it was concluded as follows:	1.  The F&J draft pleadings looked good, and all agreed to recommend to their respective client group that (a) each group of defendants would file their own plea, answer and affirmative defenses on December 5, the deadline for doing so (I will circulate a draft tailored for the Enron defendants well before then) but that (b) all the served defendants would join in the motion to show authority. Although, strictly speaking, this is not a classic case for a motion to show authority, no one saw a downside to it, and thought the presence of such a motion would be additional help in putting off any discovery requests.  The big concern in this case is keeping Grynberg from getting discovery here that could help him in his other cases.	2.  I was tasked with the job of legal research on whether the non-measurer, non-taxpayer holding companies had a good shot at a motion to transfer venue, and whether there was any downside to so moving.  Of course, under the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, such a motion must be filed before any other plea or pleading but for a special appearance, or it is waived.	3.  No one appeared interested in a joint defense fund or a formal joint defense agreement, and it was agreed that the parties would pass around projects for the common good (like item #2) on a ""rough justice"" basis.	I will continue to keep you advised.	Britt"

31748,2001-11-19 08:17:51,"	Marianne,	This will confirm our conference regarding your further due diligence.  Here are the to-do s:	1.  You will call Steve Schneider and anyone else you need to to find out whether a database still exists that captures all ENA-related sale and/or transport contracts for Zapata county from 1980-1995.	2.  With regard to the Zapata County meter numbers listed in the PCS Synergi database document that you showed me, which reflects all ENA-related purchase contracts from 1980-1995, you will double-check to make sure that there is no evidence of any purchase contract listing Enron Corp., Intratex or EGM as a counterparty.  If there is, you will research whether there was any evidence of actual purchase activity under any of these meters. With regard to the meters shown on that document, both ""off-system"" and ""on-system"", you will research who owned or operated them.	3.  With regard to the Zapata County contracts in the new Global system, which shows all ENA-related purchase, sale or transportation contracts from 1999 forward, you will research the contracts that do appear to show ENA as a counter-party for actual purchase activity and at what meters.  Also, since the report you drew up does not show meter numbers, you will drill down for those as well, and see if there are any meters in addition to those shown in the PCS Synergi document.  If there are, you will research the identity of those as well.	Please keep me closely advised.	Britt"

We have been approached by a couple of clients to advise them and to represent them if there appears no solution to Enron s problems short of protection of the bankruptcy court. Do you have an objection to our representation of them? I will assume that you have none if I do not hear from you to the contrary."

I have a great deal of interest in finance, and that is what I want to do, I really don t want to do a MBA, rather a MS in Finance. I am very ambitious and work really hard to succeed. I have great work experience and I have worked for a company that is well recognized for its talent pool.If you can t help me with this process, do you know anyone who can?

In terms of dollars BHKP was US$420.55 up US$4.46 (1.07%).Even though the movement upwards is very minimal, it is still in line with the pulp producers  attempts to raise prices. The price increases so far have been partially successful as producers have only been able to push for a US$10-15 dollar increase  instead of US$20-30 as previously announced. Still price increases are expected to continue in November. Please see attached for a chart on FOEX indeces.   Thanks,Monika Causholliext. 5-1510"

He called me because he knew me from a case in which V&E was representing a party in a commercial litigation matter, and I was representing an Enron employee in a deposition in that matter.

Unless there is something that provides me with significant comfort that the Consular route is an avenue that we are able to pursue in a timely manner, I would like to re-visit employing Tindall & Foster and would like to consider a firm in either New York or London.

40483,2001-11-26 09:16:21,"This is an alert that FERC will be more critical in the future of negotiated rate deals.  The orders discussed below dealt with buyout provisions in negotiated rate deals that Tennessee, ANR and Columbia had done.  These provisions had previously been permitted as negotiated rates, but FERC has decided that there is ""significant potential for undue discrimination"" and the recourse rates do not provide an adequate alternative.   Thus, anything in a negotiated rate deal that is not strictly rate-related will most likely be subject to intense scrutiny.FERC ADDS ANOTHER LAYER TO POLICY ON NEGOTIATED-RATE AUTHORITYActing on a series of contract-specific cases, FERC last week sharpened its policy on what is, and isnot, allowed under negotiated rates. In further defining its policy, the commission continued to leanheavily on the ""linchpin"" of negotiated-rate authority - that a customer not willing or able to negotiate adeal must always have the option of obtaining needed capacity under cost-based recourse rates.During discussion of the orders, Chairman Pat Wood III said it was ""important to keep in mind, as werush into the brave new world on the gas side,"" that ""all customers must be treated on a nondiscriminatorybasis by pipelines."" Last week s proclamation should be considered ""a reaffirmation of that nondiscriminatorytrend,"" he asserted.In representative language, the commission said it wants to ensure that parties ""are clear about contractingpractices that we find unacceptable because they present a significant potential for undue discrimination and thosethat we find acceptable because they can be permitted without substantial risk"" of such unequal treatment.FERC declared that a ""key factor"" in determining whether a negotiated provision is considered an""appropriate material deviation"" from a pipeline s filed tariff schedule is the extent to which recourse ratesprovide ""adequate alternatives"" to other shippers.In cases involving rates negotiated by ANR Pipeline Co. (GT01-25, RP99-301), Tennessee Gas PipelineCo. (RP96-312, et al.) and Columbia Gas Transmission Corp. (CP01-70), the commission ruled that thebuyout provisions are not allowed unless they are offered to all shippers as part of the pipelines  generallyavailable tariffs.The provisions at issue allow customers to buy out or terminate their contract demand levels prior tothe end of the deals. While the commission previously has held that such provisions can be included in anegotiated-rate package, ""we have reconsidered that holding"" because similar buyout opportunities arenot available to more traditional shippers operating under recourse rates, it said in the Tennessee order.Where a customer is seeking service for a set contract term and quantity, recourse service provides an""adequate alternative,"" the commission observed. ""However, if the customer desires a special contractdemand reduction or early termination right not provided in the generally applicable tariff, the availabilityof service at the recourse rate does not provide an adequate substitute, since recourse service would notinclude any such provision."" A shipper obtaining such a provision would be insulated from a certaindegree of risk, giving it ""an advantage over recourse-rate shippers,"" the commission pointed out.""A shipper s right to reduce, or terminate, its contract demand before the expiration of its contract is avaluable right, since it can enable the shipper to avoid significant liability for future reservation charges,""FERC said, adding that ""such a valuable right must be granted in a not unduly discriminatory manner.""Requiring pipelines to file generally applicable tariff provisions setting forth the conditions underwhich they will offer contract demand reduction rights ""is the best means of assuring that those rights willbe negotiated"" in a fair manner, FERC reasoned. Once approved, the tariff language ""will require thepipeline to grant similar rights to similarly situated customers.""Commissioner Linda Breathitt applauded the policy shift, characterizing it as a much-needed shot inthe arm for a program that had become ""muddled."" Through a ""tortured line of cases,"" FERC s definitionsof allowable contracting practices were ""obscured,"" Breathitt said in welcoming the new ""common-sense""approach. The ""tug of war"" that parties have engaged in over the past few years ""really hasn t served ourobjective of ensuring that nondiscriminatory rates and service"" are available to all shippers, she said."

A short synopsis:FALLING GAS PRICES TRIGGER ACTIVE RIG COUNT DECLINEThe economic downturn, lower industrial demand, moderate weather, and falling gas prices have combined to hit gas-directed drilling activity hard. Gas prices briefly fell below $2.00 per MMBtu in October. From a midsummer peak of 1,068 gas-directed rigs, the US industry active rig count plummeted to 834 by November 9 and could fall as low as 700-750. Producers  drilling plans for the 2002 budget year are already being curtailed. *  The drilling downturn could mean as many as 8,000 fewer gas wells in the United States over the next 12 months and 1.5 to 2.0 billion cubic feet per day of lost production.*  The majority of the activity reduction is onshore, but the significant drop in Gulf of Mexico shallow shelf drilling will have a huge impact on productive capacity. *  Gas supply could be extremely tight once again next year just as the economy recovers, and gas demand is expected to rebound with it."

44204,2001-11-13 08:05:42,"NGI s Daily Gas Price Index published : November 13, 2001Watson: Enron Upside  Clearly Worth Doing the Deal  Dynegy CEO Chuck Watson told the investment community Monday that he was ""90% sure"" that the risk/reward ratio in the planned merger with Enron Corp. made it ""clearly worth doing the deal,"" because the issues that decimated the former market leader were with its non-core businesses. Explaining that his team had ""adequately bracketed the downside,"" as the deal fell together over the past few weeks, Watson said he could not be ""99% positive,"" but noted that the upside was ""substantial,"" and said he had a ""good deal of confidence...that we ll be absolutely fine here."" Dynegy, which announced a $22 billion cash, stock and debt deal with its downtown Houston rival on Friday night, joined with Enron executives including Chairman Kenneth Lay on Monday to answer as many questions as they could in about 90 minutes. If all goes to plan, the two companies would become Dynegy Inc. by the third quarter of 2002, the clear leader in natural gas and power marketing. In the second quarter 2001, Enron and Dynegy combined sold a total of 36.2 Bcf/d of gas, which represented 21% of the volumes sold by the top 20 gas marketers in North America (168.9 Bcf/d), according to a ranking by NGI. Enron was the top gas marketer with 25.3 Bcf/d and Dynegy was No. 6 with 10.9 Bcf/d. Statistics provided by Maryland-based Energy Performance Review (EPR) show that Enron and Dynegy combined sold 143,824 million kWh of power in the second quarter. That total represented 14% of the power sold by the top 20 largest power marketers (1,000,961 million kWh), according to EPR. Enron was in fifth place among power marketers with 73,724 million kWh sold, while Dynegy was in sixth place with 70,100 million kWh. The blending of the two will not come without challenges, but Watson stressed he expects to see more opportunities than problems. The opportunity appears to have come none too soon for Enron. Greg Whalley, Enron s president and a future member of Dynegy s executive team, confirmed that without some kind of equity investment in the company, the once market leader probably could not have sustained its liquidity through the rest of this year. ""We definitely needed to raise some type of equity capital,"" said Whalley. ""Under normal market conditions, we would have had adequate liquidity. This was not normal for Enron. We would not have had liquidity to the end of the year."" Asked about asset sales in anticipation of meeting federal requirements to merge, executives acknowledged there would be some, but did not elaborate. Whalley said that from an ""Enron perspective, we have not spent a lot of time with Dynegy people to agree on a plan. Chuck (Watson) has to clear what is core to Dynegy. There are several (assets for consideration to sell) on the list."" Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay, who will not be part of the management team, but may hold a place on the Dynegy board of directors, added that Enron already has $4 billion in sales under contract, all expected to close by the end of 2002. ""We also have three other significant international assets under contract,"" said Lay, referring to the among other things, the Dabhol power plant in India. Once the merger of Dynegy with Enron is successfully completed, the new Dynegy will become the ""primary market player in all markets,"" but there will be a significant difference in how the company moves forward, noted Dynegy CFO Rob Doty. Enron s financial-backed trading strategy will merge with the ""strong asset base"" of Dynegy s. Dynegy has protected itself on the downside, however. The deal includes an out for Dynegy if Enron s legal liabilities exceed $3.5 billion. Asked about the possibility that some of Enron s marketing and trading team may desert the company for another company, Watson, stressing that teamwork will be the guiding force going forward, said, ""if I were in this industry, this is the combination I d work for. This is an exciting day here. It s been an exciting couple of weeks"" creating a ""platform for something really special in the future."" Enron s Whalley said that he believes the company will keep most of its team intact. ""They re accustomed to being part of a winning deal,"" he said, and ""going forward, they will be very pleased with the additional infusion of equity and the stability in the marketplace."" As of Monday morning, Whalley said that ""activity looks pretty good,"" and said there had been a positive reception to the merger. ""Right now, people are pleased with the introduction of new liquidity, and really want to go about establishing or re-establishing the energy franchise."" Dynegy President Steve Bergstrom agreed. ""Most traders want to be part of a winning team. This is a combination that will be a winning team. We have similar issues there as well. The  A  players will stay around to be part of the winning team."" Bergstrom explained that when the merger is complete, the new Dynegy will become the ""primary player in all markets."" He said Dynegy has a ""more asset-backed strategy,"" adding that he has said before that ""you can only have one market maker and Enron clearly was it."" By combining the two companies, there will be a blend of Dynegy s asset strategy with Enron s ""financial skill set,"" giving the new entity ""more liquidity market-making than Dynegy itself has historically done."" Added Watson, ""both companies had a successful ratio and nothing is going to change there...I m a strong believer in teams and the team concept. I don t want to see individuals do well if the company doesn t do well. It (will be) imbedded in the whole company."" Ben Schlesinger, whose company Schlesinger & Associates analyzes the energy industry, said Monday that the big problem in the merger is ""whether these two companies are able to pull together...to harness what s there."" He said the ""two parties are clearly leaders,"" but theoretically, they will have to streamline their operations. ""Both books are fairly strong,"" he said, and once their efficiencies are put together, the new company will offer ""stable returns."" In the ""very short term,"" however, Schlesinger said there will be moves to other traders. Other analysts also seemed to be throwing support behind the merger. UBS Warburg reiterated its ""strong buy"" rating on Dynegy, noting that ""if successfully executed, this transaction would yield the most widely recognized, respected and downright credible wholesale/retail energy merchant in the world."" However, UBS warned that Dynegy still faces a ""daunting"" task in merging the operations and employees. ""We are not naive in underestimating the enormous challenge at hand. In the near-term, Enron must remain highly liquid, investment grade and its employees must remain focused on keeping its core wholesale/retail franchises up and running."" Merrill Lynch s Donato Eassey reiterated the ""buy"" on Dynegy and ""moving to no opinion"" on Enron. He said, ""Dynegy has all the necessary skill sets and as importantly, the financial stability, resources and investor confidence and experience to get the job done...Enron s unparalleled online trading business should translate to significant prospects for the new Dynegy."" Curt Launer, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston, added that despite the size of the new company, ""we do not expect major divestitures or closing issues because of the lack of asset concentration and the inherent competitiveness of the natural gas and power marketing business."" He noted too that with the combination, ""we have modeled a merchant unit that does 25% less business,"" because of ""cross trading between them and some expectation of a loss of market share."" Still, Launer said Dynegy would become a ""formidable competitor"" benefiting from a market share in excess of 20% of U.S. natural gas and power trading markets."" As expected with most major merger announcements, Moody s Investors Service placed the ratings of Dynegy and its subsidiaries under review for possible downgrade, noting that ""notwithstanding the franchise benefits of the proposed merger, the financial and business risks associated with the transaction could negatively impact Dynegy s credit fundamentals."" The review affects about $4 billion of Dynegy securities, including its subsidiaries Illinova Corp. and Illinois Power Co. In its rating review, Moody s said it will ""assess Dynegy s plans to meet the liquidity needs of the combined entity and to deal with the uncertainty surrounding Enron s off-balance sheet transactions and contingent risks...and examine the ultimate structure of the transaction, and its impact on Dynegy s financial leverage and on management s targeted debt levels."" The ratings service also plans to ""consider the governance framework within which the combined trading activities will operate."" Ratings under review are: Dynegy s Prime-3 rating for commercial paper; Dynegy Holdings  Baa2 senior unsecured debt rating and its Prime-2 rating for commercial paper; Illinova Corp. s Baa3 senior unsecured debt rating; and Illinois Power Co. s Baa1 senior secured and Baa2 senior unsecured debt ratings, and its Prime-2 rating for commercial paper. Fitch revised its rating watch on Enron s outstanding securities to ""evolving"" from ""negative,"" where they were placed in late October. The rating watch evolving means the ratings may be raised, lowered or maintained. Fitch also placed a rating watch negative on Dynegy and Dynegy Holding s long-term credit ratings, which also means they could be lowered or affirmed. The outstanding ""F2"" rated commercial paper programs for Dynegy and Dynegy Holdings were not affected."

47172,2002-01-16 07:56:33,"FERC Approves North Baja Pipe The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Wednesday voted to approve the proposed North Baja Pipeline which will deliver 500 MMcf/d of natural gas from a connection with El Paso Natural Gas near Ehrenberg, AZ, to gas distribution systems and new power plants in northern Mexico and Southern California. The U.S. line, which is being built by PG&E Corp. s National Energy Group, would extend 80 miles to border-crossing facilities near Yuma, AZ. It is expected to cost about $146 million. The Mexican government already has issued a transportation permit to Sempra Energy International to build the 135-mile Mexican portion, Gasoducto Baja norte, to Mexicali, Baja California. FERC s approval came after the FERC staff, and the staffs of the California State Lands Commission and the Interior Department s Bureau of Land Management issued a favorable final environmental impact statement. The Commission already had issued a preliminary determination, approving all non-environmental aspects of the project. If the project ""is constructed as modified and in accordance with [North Baja  s] proposed mitigation and our recommendations, it would be an environmentally acceptable action,"" the staffs of the three agencies concluded in the final environmental impact statement (FEIS) on the pipeline (CP01-22). The pipeline could be delivering gas to the first of two new power plants in Mexicali as early as mid-summer. Work has been underway for some time on the longer, Mexican portion of the line which runs from Yuma, AZ, near the Mexican border to the Rosarito Beach area south of Tijuana in the northwest corner of Baja."

The credit worthiness in Alberta determines the trading limits for each participant in relation to its bond rating as follows: Rating		trading limitAAA		$25,000,000AA		$20,000,000A		$15,000,000BBB		$10,000,000<BBB		$0Trading limit is a defined term and means the maximum financial obligation to which a participant is or is expected to be owing the pool administrator.   I am currently investigating of the current levels of our trading levels as that will determine the action required.  If a participant s financial obligations are expected to exceed the trading limit , the participant must provide a payment in advance or other form of financial security.  This security may be in the form of a bank guarantee, letter of guarantee, irrevocable letter of credit, or cash deposits drawn on a Canadian Chartered Bank, trust company, credit union or other lending institution acceptable to Council in or for an amount determined by the pool administrator to be equal to the expected financial obligations in excess of the trading limit.It is noteworthy that a rating with a plus or minus sign indicates the relative standing within the major rating categories (so A- is A).  An exception to this is a rating of BBB minus which falls in the <BBB category and therefore no unsecured credit is granted.

I am led to believe that this entity is an Enron Energy Services, Inc. (""EESI"") entity which bought some assets from PG&E, possibly.In order to maximise our credit flexibility and minimise our collateral obligations would you be kind enough to advise as to whether this entity is trading or requires NEPOOL to fulfill any obligations to customers and if not, we would want to cancel the bond.If indeed the bond is needed, could you see if there is a way to transfer the obligations which require the bond to be in place for EEMC, from EEMC to EESI, in order that we can position ourselves to cancel the bond. In respect of any such transfer we would want to ensure that there was no increase in the obligation upon EESI as to the amount of the bonds required to be posted. EESI currently has $20,000,000 in bonds posted with ISO-NE. 	If ISO-NE required the amount of the bonds to be increased, in the event that the obligations of EEMC were transferred to EESI, Travis, please could you advise as to whether the DIP financing agreements will permit us to issue new bonds, if the net effect was to reduce the amount of bonds issued as between all Enron entities.

The security requirement they have calculated (contained in Craig s earlier e-mail) of $1.0 million follows a process that is used for all gas marketers and was approved through the ""Gas Roundtable"" in MD, a cross-sectional group of industry players in MD.  In other words, the MD Commission would uphold this calculation.I talked to Frank Donnelly, financing director, and Shelley Jennings, corporate treasurer, of WGL about the calculation.  Nearly all of the collateral is related to ""delivery risk"", which is 60 days of peak day usage, reduced by about 50%, priced at a forward NYMEX price.

The creditworthiness standards vary by utility, and also depends on the billing option chosen by the ARES. However, the single billing option (SBO) has creditworthiness standards that have general application because SBO certification is an ICC responsibility with uniform qualification criteria. All the applicable credit requirements set out below are cumulative.Enron s Credit Rating of BBB(S&P), and Baa2(Moody s)General Creditworthiness: Under Section 451.50 Subchapter C of the IL Admin. Code, as part of the qualification as an ARES all applicants must fulfill a general license bond requirement. In IL, EES is licensed to serve nonresidential retail customers with maximum electrical demand of 1MW or more. To secure this license, EES was required to post bond in the sum of $30,000. The bond is valid for one year, and conditioned on the full and faithful performance of all duties and obligations of EES as an ARES. If the license bond is cancelled, modified, expires or is drawn upon, EES must execute and maintain an additional or replacement bond, such that the cumulative value of all outstanding bonds never falls below the required amount. The EES license bond expired on June 2001. EES must issue another bond or provide an extension certificate up to June 2002, and annually thereafter.Registration Under SubPart B:EES is registered as an ARES under Subpart B of Section 451.100 - expedited certification for ARES that seek to serve only non-residential customers with maximum demand of  1MW or more. Subpart B has additional financial qualifications	1. To maintain certification under Subpart B, EES needs to maintain at least one of the following long-term credit ratings of BBB- (S&P), Baa3 (Moody s), BBB- (Duff 	& Phelps), or BBB- (Fitch); or	2.  Maintain a borrowing agreement with an affiliate that has the above ratings. The amount of credit available to EES under the borrowing agreement shall 	not be less than $500,000 or 5% of EES  revenue for last fiscal year; or		3. Show that the EES obligations arising from electric energy and fuel purchases are covered by an unconditional guaranty, bond, or LC, in an amount not less than  	$500,000 or 5% of EES s revenue for the last fiscal year; or	4. Certify that it will reimburse its IL retail customers for additional costs they incur to acquire electricity upon EES  contractual failure. This certification shall be 	covered by an unconditional guaranty, bond, or LC in the sum of 1080 times the maximum MW EES estimates to schedule in the next 12 months, multiplied by the 	average of the 45 highest daily market prices of energy traded in the previous year; or		5. EES maintains a  line of credit or revolving credit agreement in the amount of $500,000 or 5% of its revenue for last fiscal year, from an ""A"" rated financial 	insitution; or		6. EES earns 12 points on the financial ratios - pre-tax interest coverage, funds from operations interest coverage, funds from operations to total debt, and total debt 	to total capital.Enron s Credit Rating and downgrades: To satisfy the Subpart B requirements, EES provided an unconditional guaranty from Enron Corp. Given our current credit rating of BBB(S&P) and Baa2 (Moody s), that guaranty is still valid. However, if Enron Corp is downgraded below the required credit level, EES will have to provide any of the above alternative forms of creditworthiness.IMPACT: The above creditworthiness requirements relate to EES s ability to do business in IL. Failure to maintain the foregoing standards will result in the loss of our IL license. This will trigger contractual default for all our customers, both financial and physical. Please note that, EES is out of compliance on the license bond and needs to post a new bond ASAP.Single Bill Option:Pursuant to Section 451.500, Subpart F, any ARES that chooses the Single Bill Option (SBO), must demonstrate ability to establish and maintain sufficient financial resources to satisfy the obligation to remit to the utilities, monies that it collects under the SBO tariff. To satisfy these additional creditworthiness standards, EES must either:	1. Post and maintain bond in the amount of 15% of its estimated obligation to the utility under the SBO	2. Provide an irrevocable LC issued by a financial insitution with an ""A"" rating	3. Maintain at least the following long term credit ratings, a BBB- (S&P), Baa3 (Moody s), BBB-(duff &Phelps, BBB- (Fitch)		4. Provide an unconditional guaranty from an affiliate with the above ratings.Enron s Current Rating: EES is currently working to obtain ICC certification under the SBO tariff. This means that EES must maintain the minimum long term credit ratings set out in 3, or provide a guaranty from an affiliate with those ratings. EES is not rated. However, given Enron Corp s current credit rating of BBB and Baa2, a parental guaranty will suffice to meet the qualification under the SBO tariff. Further Downgrades: If Enron Corp is down graded below the required minimum ratings, EES will need to provide a bond or LC, or forego the SBO option.IMPACT: EES will continue to do business in IL as an ARES. Thus EES will maintain its ability to service its customers both financial and physical. However, there could be substantial impact on EES customer service and operation, particularly our ability to meet customer expectations and timely collect outstanding receivables.Instrument Fund Charges: (akin to stranded costs)Under the Illinois tariffs, EES can choose annually, one of two remittance timelines for IFC charges. (1) To remit IFC charges within 7 days of receipt of customer payment, or more frequently as required; or (2) within 15 days of utility invoicing, whether or not customer has paid. If EES chooses the 2nd option, it has to provide a security deposit equal to one month s estimated IFC charges for all EES  customers. Deposit amount will be determined based on monthly KW customer usage, and the IFC charge per KWH. If the expected IFC charge for EES  customers is $5,000,000 or more, this deposit amount will be revised monthly.If EES chooses the 2nd option - remittance of bills within 15 days of utility invoicing, we will be required to provide the deposit.IMPACT: This deposit requirement for the IFC charges relate to Illinois Power customers and not to ComEd. For ComEd, IFC charges nets out to zero, and customers do not pay those charges. EES is currently doing business as a billing agent in IP s service territory, and is required to execute the Billing Agent Agreement which will implement the deposit requirement. If EES chooses the first remittance option, it will avoid the deposit requirement. However, this may have operational implications."

A summary of this policy is as follows:1.	To assure credit worthiness, a NYISO customer may provide a cash deposit, an unconditional and irrevocable letter of credit (from an acceptable American or Canadian Bank with A credit rating from S&P, or A2 by Moody s), or obtain corporate guarantee from its parent company for all financial obligations under the tariffs; assuming that the parent company complies with credit ratings acceptable.  The amount of the instrument equals the sum of the customer s obligations to the NYISO for three months (the greatest over a rolling 12-month period).2.	In lieu of cash deposits, letters of credit, or corporate guarantee, the customer must submit initially, and annually thereafter, a current debt-rating agency of a minimum of ""BBB"" or ""Baa2"" by SP, or Moody s respectively.  3.	Any services provided under the Tariff may be terminated either immediately (for Service Tariffs) or upon 60 days prior notice (OATT) if the customer fails to demonstrate its creditworthiness.  A NYISO customer must immediately inform the NYISO of any material change in its financial position."

Julie S. was adamant the FERC staff need some input. I trust her judgement so I too support  getting a ""leave behind"" to them even if EPSA s position is still evolving.I think we can support Craig Roach s advice, which is in the draft, to go for the Economic Capacity test, which is a simplified Delivered Price Test.   As with any test, the devil is in the  details but everyone on the call seems this test can be kept simple. Craig agreed to send me an example of such a test. Most of Jim s issues got raised in the call and will be incorporated in the draft.The tension/dilemma of trading off 1x, supplier-specific MBR certificate for a blanket MBR certificate to any participant in a properly structured RTO came up several times.  Everyone recognizes that we ll need a replacement for hub-N-spoke before RTO s will obviate the need for certificates altogether.  That being said, I still think we should support such a trade because it keeps a beneif of  RTOs (everone gets MBR) highly visible.The highlight of the call was Huntoon s/Dynegy s request to raise the stranded costs created by changing the standard for MBR.  Julie said it would not pass the laugh test but he would not back down.  I tend to agree with Julie:  if you built an asset on getting market based rates and because of a change in standards you are forced to cost-of-service, I am hard pressed to agree you have a valid stranded cost claim (i.e., you will still get return of and return on your plant).  I think it is better to focus on the going-forward impact of bad tests (e.g., loss of investors, loss of market participants, etc.)Finally, all of Chriti s comments were essentially addressed between the 1st and 2nd drafts.

48405,2001-11-27 13:17:47,"My understanding is that we have posted bonds in excess of $60M and are in compliance with the NEPOOL Financial Assurance Policy.EPMI and EES are not relying upon an Enron Corp. guaranty to provide any part of the financial assurance required by NEPOOL. 	Suggest we can take one of four courses of action:  (1)   Do nothing;					    	   (2)    Request and authorize the ISO-NE to disclose to concerned NEPOOL participants the fact that EPMI and EES 						           have posted bonds to ensure compliance with the NEPOOL Financial Assurance Policy and that no part of the    						           financial assurance required is provided by an Enron Corp. guaranty;					   	   (3)    Send a letter to all NEPOOL participants confirming that EPMI and EES financial assurance obligations are being 						           met solely by the posting of bonds;									               (4)    Combination of both (2) and (3).	If there is a perception or a clear understanding that the credit downgrade of Enron Corp. is the reason for a reduction in trading activity with EPMI and/or EES in NEPOOL and that NEPOOL participants will respond favorably if they knew that the financial assurance is provided by way of bonds, not an Enron Corp. guaranty, then option (1) should be discarded.	Option (2) may be enough to give the comfort to ""concerned"" participants.	Option (3) and (4) will ensure that any letter we send out will make its way into the press, almost as soon as it is sent and if we send any such letter out we need to be prepared to meet any media interest. Further, the publication of any such letter in the press may encourage other counterparties in other forum to demand that EPMI and/or EES post bonds in order to continue trading and could materially adversely affect our trading activities.	If we considered that any disclosure would make a material difference to the confidence that NEPOOL participants have in trading with EPMI and/or EES, my recommendation would be to pursue Option (2).Marcus	 "

Thanks. -----Original Message-----From: 	Allegretti, Daniel  Sent:	Tuesday, November 27, 2001 1:40 PMTo:	Nicolay, Christi L.Subject:	nepool financial assuranceI got a call today from Ed McKenna, the ISO-NE treasurer.  He is getting a large volume of calls from NEPOOL Participants concerned about Enron Corp s credit rating.  He is telling these Participants that his office only monitors whether NEPOOL members EPMI and EES are in compliance with the NEPOOL Financial Assurance Policy, which they are, and does not monitor Enron Corp.  Ed suggested that when PG&E experienced difficulties PG&E drafted a short notice, which ISO-NE circulated, explaining how its subsidiaries were not affected by the credit rating of the parent.  The ISO is offering us the same opportunity to draft and circulate something similar if we wish.What may be going on here is a concern by NEPOOL Participants that we are using a parent guaranty to meet the Financial Assurance Policy.  My recollection, however, is that we have instead posted surety bonds from AA agencies to meet NEPOOL credit requirements.  If we disclosed this to the NEPOOL Participants it might allay their credit concerns.  We may however, not want to disclose this if we are employing parent guarantees elsewhere, lest we be asked to post surety bonds everywhere.  Can you discuss this with the traders and see what they want to do?"
48411,2001-11-27 12:09:51,"This is a quick note to let the team know that I do have the credit worthiness requirements for PX (FERC Electric Service Tariff, Art. 2.4); a summary could be prepared if needed.   I trust that the Team would benefit from a legal opinion on Art. 2.4.5, and the associated schedule 2 of the tariff  related to ""Changes in the Amount of Security Provided by a PX Participant""  which allows a refund of securities above the PX security Amount.  As Steve mentioned nicely below, if the security amount is zero, then perhaps there is an argument for a full refund.On the same theme, I am investigating  the requirements for maintaining ESP (electricity service provider) in California.  One of the conditions is that the ESP is eligible as a participant in the CA ISO.  If the CA ISO also necessitates participant status in the PX for  some transactions, then there is a circular flow in the argument, and may be there is a need to maintain a form of relationship with the PX.I shall keep you posted with progress.BrgrdsAI "

It is based on historical usage patterns and expected weather conditions but must be less than the MPDQ.The MPDQ (Max Peak Day Quantity) is the max gas the customer can take on a winter day, based on a day with 75 heating degree days.  Customers are assigned a MPDQ based on a ""Base and Thermal Methodology"", which calculates an expected peak day usage.SO the point here is that there is some latitude in how they define MDQ.

48481,2001-11-26 09:16:21,"This is an alert that FERC will be more critical in the future of negotiated rate deals.  The orders discussed below dealt with buyout provisions in negotiated rate deals that Tennessee, ANR and Columbia had done.  These provisions had previously been permitted as negotiated rates, but FERC has decided that there is ""significant potential for undue discrimination"" and the recourse rates do not provide an adequate alternative.   Thus, anything in a negotiated rate deal that is not strictly rate-related will most likely be subject to intense scrutiny.FERC ADDS ANOTHER LAYER TO POLICY ON NEGOTIATED-RATE AUTHORITYActing on a series of contract-specific cases, FERC last week sharpened its policy on what is, and isnot, allowed under negotiated rates. In further defining its policy, the commission continued to leanheavily on the ""linchpin"" of negotiated-rate authority - that a customer not willing or able to negotiate adeal must always have the option of obtaining needed capacity under cost-based recourse rates.During discussion of the orders, Chairman Pat Wood III said it was ""important to keep in mind, as werush into the brave new world on the gas side,"" that ""all customers must be treated on a nondiscriminatorybasis by pipelines."" Last week s proclamation should be considered ""a reaffirmation of that nondiscriminatorytrend,"" he asserted.In representative language, the commission said it wants to ensure that parties ""are clear about contractingpractices that we find unacceptable because they present a significant potential for undue discrimination and thosethat we find acceptable because they can be permitted without substantial risk"" of such unequal treatment.FERC declared that a ""key factor"" in determining whether a negotiated provision is considered an""appropriate material deviation"" from a pipeline s filed tariff schedule is the extent to which recourse ratesprovide ""adequate alternatives"" to other shippers.In cases involving rates negotiated by ANR Pipeline Co. (GT01-25, RP99-301), Tennessee Gas PipelineCo. (RP96-312, et al.) and Columbia Gas Transmission Corp. (CP01-70), the commission ruled that thebuyout provisions are not allowed unless they are offered to all shippers as part of the pipelines  generallyavailable tariffs.The provisions at issue allow customers to buy out or terminate their contract demand levels prior tothe end of the deals. While the commission previously has held that such provisions can be included in anegotiated-rate package, ""we have reconsidered that holding"" because similar buyout opportunities arenot available to more traditional shippers operating under recourse rates, it said in the Tennessee order.Where a customer is seeking service for a set contract term and quantity, recourse service provides an""adequate alternative,"" the commission observed. ""However, if the customer desires a special contractdemand reduction or early termination right not provided in the generally applicable tariff, the availabilityof service at the recourse rate does not provide an adequate substitute, since recourse service would notinclude any such provision."" A shipper obtaining such a provision would be insulated from a certaindegree of risk, giving it ""an advantage over recourse-rate shippers,"" the commission pointed out.""A shipper s right to reduce, or terminate, its contract demand before the expiration of its contract is avaluable right, since it can enable the shipper to avoid significant liability for future reservation charges,""FERC said, adding that ""such a valuable right must be granted in a not unduly discriminatory manner.""Requiring pipelines to file generally applicable tariff provisions setting forth the conditions underwhich they will offer contract demand reduction rights ""is the best means of assuring that those rights willbe negotiated"" in a fair manner, FERC reasoned. Once approved, the tariff language ""will require thepipeline to grant similar rights to similarly situated customers.""Commissioner Linda Breathitt applauded the policy shift, characterizing it as a much-needed shot inthe arm for a program that had become ""muddled."" Through a ""tortured line of cases,"" FERC s definitionsof allowable contracting practices were ""obscured,"" Breathitt said in welcoming the new ""common-sense""approach. The ""tug of war"" that parties have engaged in over the past few years ""really hasn t served ourobjective of ensuring that nondiscriminatory rates and service"" are available to all shippers, she said."

A  DASR can only be processed if the customer name appears on the ESPList submitted to the UDCs on October 5, 2001.2. In order to submit an ESP List the ESP must have a valid ESP/UDC ServiceAgreement as of September 20, 2001 and , for ESPs serving small customers,they must have in effect a valid Commission registration as of September 20,2001.3. For a DASR to be processed for a residential or small commercial customeraccount, the ESP must be able to demonstrate that the required third partyverification took place prior to September 20, 2001.4.  Customers should not be allowed to switch from one ESP to another afterSeptember 20 unless the new ESP had a valid ESP- customer contract in placeon or before Sept. 20th.5.  Seamless moves within a UDC s service territory will be allowed.6. For customers on bundled service as of September 20, 2001 (but stillunder a DA contract), the UDCs are proposing not to allow such customers toprocess DASRs even if their names are on the October 5 list.7.  If all  accounts of one ESP transferred to another as a result of amerger, then the situation is okay because no new DASR would be required;requests for one customer to switch from one ESP to another only allowed ifthe new ESP-customer relationship had a contract prior to Sept. 20, 2001.8. Changes in customer identity allowed on  case by case basis (e.g., if acustomer changes its type of business it would not be allowed).9. One  customer can not transfer or assign its direct access service rightsto another.10.  Processing of DASRs submitted for customers who attempt to opt into acommunity aggregation program after the suspension date should not beallowed.In addition to the above, the UDCs proposed three additional options forimplementing the suspension.1.  The Commission should impose a DASR cut-off date (received andaccepted).2.  If the Commission does not impose a strict DASR cut off, it shouldrequire that any ESP which wishes to have a DASR processed after the cut offto submit their account specific DASR information and ESP contract to theCommission along with an explanation of why the customer is eligible toreceive DA.  The UDC will not process the DASR until it receives an okayfrom the Commission.3.

48734,2001-12-19 14:50:45, Don - here s what we have so far.  Will provide the rest tomorrow.
48747,2001-12-19 07:16:54,"Jim	Speaking with Don Miller last night he has indicated that Jeff McMahon would like to secure our membership and ongoing participation in NEPOOL and possibly other Pools, and is prepared to make cash available through the Cash Committee.	While we discussed a number of options, the starting point is to identify the contracts that are in the money to EPMI and which have not yet been terminated. The long term deals that we have been looking at in NEPOOL are NSTAR, UI and CMP. We are getting closer to an acceptable internal valuation of these and need to get a ""robust"" number that we can defend in order to release cash from the Cash Committee.	The three main cash related issues we need to address as I see it in the short term are: (1) We must provide NEPOOL with the comfort, possibly even in the form of a pre-pay, that we will pay our invoices for November, especially since the bonds we posted terminate on 29, December (2) We must provide cash collateral immediately and (3) We will need pay our NEPOOL invoices over a two, or possibly, one week period to reduce NEPOOL s exposure to EPMI. This creates cash flow issues as we are only paid monthly by our customers. With the one way payment issue we are facing with NSTAR and UI there is clearly little incentive for them to re-negotiate their contracts.	Turning to point (2), it is not clear to me whether we will be able to post the $137,390,360.10 and I will assume that we will not get the authority to post this but a lesser amount. In trying to provide NEPOOL with comfort as to their exposures it may be that we can get them to agree that for the foreseeable future we will only be serving certain contracts and that the collateral requirement be based solely on EPMI serving those contracts. I am not confident however that NEPOOL has the authority to what is in effect change the Financial Assurance Policy for one Participant, without approval of all Participants and approval of FERC, but we can explore this with them.If the price of energy, ICAP and other services moves up then EPMI should be given a reasonable period of time to post further collateral. That way we can hopefully reduce the initial amount we post and if the price moves up we can elect at that point whether to retain our membership or relinquish it. While EPMI will be taking market risk, which ill not be hedged, it will have the ability to stop performing f the price moves against it. It should not be forgotten that both the NSTAR and UI deals are one way payments and there is no time limit as to when either of these counterparties can claim a default due to EPMI s bankruptcy. The effect of this being that we are at risk from a termination by these two counterparties at any time and since we are currently the ""Defaulting Party"" we would not receive any Early Termination Payment. CMP is a two way payment and therefore there may well be some merit in entering into a term energy purchase deal to lock in value to this contract.	I am not aware of what EES is trying to do with NEPOOL, or the other pools in the North East, however I thought it would be helpful if they knew what we were trying to do and why. Any input as to what EES is doing and any merit in a joint approach could be explored if both companies considered value could be achieved.	Finally, the recipients of this email will hopefully know of other people, for example in credit, scheduling and settlements who could assist in ensuring that we can accurately value and schedule the contracts we would like to continue performing under, please pass these on to Don Miller who is coordinating this initiative.	Regards,	Marcus"

I have been an instrumental part in pushing for the formation of the wholesale electric quadrant of EISB.  Although I have not committed to making a presentation at this workshop, there was a possibility that I would be speaking on behalf of EPSA.  The meeting is a critical juncture for the EISB vs NERC showdown.   NERC will likely present its latest restructuring proposal which includes a 9 sector model.  I and other EPSA members have been advocating much fewer sectors for EISB.  A key point of the NERC proposal is that it may be able to accomodate an EISB approval process for standards.  This is imporatant in that it may be able to resolve the dichotomy between NERC expertise/infrastructure and EISB s reknowned (including FERC) consensus building process.  NERC could retain its standards development expertise, however, lose its biased voting process.I think it is important to have coverage for this meeting, either, by someone on the NERC team or someone close to NERC in Washington.  The likely outcome of this meeting is a solidifying of industry support for either the NERC approach, or a clean slate EISB approach.Jim would like for us to have a conference call to discuss.

51081,2001-11-02 08:17:37,"Another wrinkle in the El Paso/CPUC Complaint case.  I ve also attached a copy of the El Paso Merchant answer to the FERC enforcement staff motion in case you re interested.NGI s Daily Gas Price Index published : November 2, 2001El Paso Seeks to Derail Further Market Power Investigation The motion by the enforcement staff of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for a ""more complete investigation"" of unused capacity on the system of El Paso Natural Gas is ""an abuse of process,"" the pipeline and its merchant energy affiliate claimed Thursday, since it comes after the case has been fully litigated. In filing a motion to strike the enforcement staff s request for the investigation, El Paso Natural Gas and El Paso Merchant Energy said the staff motion is a violation of their due process rights, since an initial decision in the case was issued three weeks ago (see Daily GPI, Oct. 10 <http://intelligencepress.com/subscribers/daily/news/d20011010c.html>). At that time Chief Administrative Law Judge Curtis Wagner Jr. recommended the dismissal of charges that El Paso and its affiliate exercised market power to drive up prices for gas transported to the border beginning in mid-2000 [RP00-241]. The judge had concluded that the complainants in the case failed to carry their burden of proof that the El Paso companies exercised market power by withholding capacity from the market. After the parties file briefs on the ALJ s decision, all that remains is a vote by the commissioners, the El Paso companies pointed out. The investigation sought by the Market Oversight and Enforcement Section (MOE) of the Office of General Counsel ""seeks to improperly shift the burden of proof by requiring El Paso and Merchant Energy to prove that they did not withhold capacity. This argument turns the Commission s adjudicatory procedures -- and its procedural safeguards -- on their head,"" the companies said. ""MOE is attempting to inappropriately influence the decision-making process in this already high profile case,"" putting the integrity of FERC s adjudicatory process in jeopardy. ""The rules under which the complaint is to be judged have become a moving target, El Paso s and Merchant Energy s due process rights and reputation have been harmed, and they have been put in the untenable position of now trying to prove a negative. MOE s improper comments should be disregarded and stricken from the record in this proceeding,"" the companies said. MOE said the issue it was raising -- whether El Paso made its unused capacity available to shippers on an IT basis, as required by FERC s open-access rule -- was neither the focus of the hearing last summer nor Wagner s initial decision (see Daily GPI, Nov. 1) <http://intelligencepress.com/subscribers/daily/news/d20011101d.html>.. MOE said its review of the public portion of the hearing record suggests that El Paso may have committed ""potential violations"" of FERC s Part 284 open-access regulations by withholding IT capacity in an attempt to keep prices up at the California border, but it said there may be ""other potential explanations"" for the existence of unused capacity on the pipeline. ""We recommend a more complete investigation of the reasons why capacity went unused on the pipeline at times during the period [of] November 2000 through March 2001."" MOE conceded its motion was an ""unusual"" move. It suggested that the Commission either direct MOE to conduct a further probe, remand the decision to Judge Wagner for consideration or use other procedures. Although ""this step is unusual, it is not unprecedented for the Commission s enforcement staff to inform the Commission of its views regarding potential violations concerning a pending proceeding,"" MOE said. El Paso pointed to a statement by the judge to back up its claim that parties in the proceeding had agreed that the pipeline was full from November through March. Here is a copy of the El Paso Merchant Energy response summarized above.  They used some pretty strong language!! --------- Inline attachment follows ---------From:  <rrich@bracepatt.com>To: Cantrell, Rebecca W. </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Bcantre>Date: Thursday, November 1, 2001 10:33:33 GMTSubject: EPNG/EPME s response"
51082,2001-11-02 14:30:59,"Some background on this issue:  It has been a hot topic at GISB for a number of months now.  It was first raised by AGA and a few LDCs (Brooklyn Union, in particular) in a rehearing request on one of the proceedings where a pipeline was filing compliance with Order 587 (the order requiring compliance with GISB).  GISB moved the issue into one of the committees, and the LDCs and a few marketers have been fighting over it ever since.  I understand that some pipelines side with the LDCs and some of them don t feel strongly about it one way or the other.  Ultimately, GISB reported to FERC that they weren t able to resolve the issue due to the conflicting viewpoints of the various segments.  Thus, the NOPR.Input from the traders is that they don t have objections to Partial Day Recalls as long as we know the capacity is released with that right reserved, so we can value our bids accordingly.  Leslie is going to write a short pleading to emphasize this position and point out that releasing shippers should be able to specify whether or not they intended to make the release subject to partial day recalls.  It shouldn t be a big deal, because they now have to specify whether or not they are subject to the current recall provisions.  It was not spelled out in the NOPR.  We will talk to Joe, but I ve been told the Enron pipelines are not too concerned about it.By the way, I had to join Brian Redmond for a conference call yesterday at 2:30, so I couldn t join the EPSA call.  It sounds like they haven t decided whether to file or not. "
51462,2001-11-14 16:11:50,"Forwarded as discussed.  Doug Gilbert Smith has asked that your group draft= a complaint to the PUCT regarding this misinterpretation of the Protocols =by the ERCOT ISO, which effectively requires a generator called on for the =OOMC ancillary service to run its plant, and sidesteps the obligation to pa=y an OOME price component when the plant s output is utilized by ERCOT.  Th=e OOMC compensation is currently negligible (and recovery of actual costs u=nder Protocols Sec. 6.8.2.1(6) may take a long time), and the OOME compensa=tion has various problems as well: (1) the more ERCOT calls on a plant for =OOME, the the lesser the OOME price paid (Protocols Sec. 6.8.2.2 -- Heat Ra=te value decreases), and (2) plants directed to provide, say, 135MWs of OOM=C/OOME, are not allowed to generate above 135 MWs in an interval (thus runn=ing the plant economically at a lower heat rate) to sell the excess in the =marketplace. The Frontera plant, a customer of EPMI acting as QSE, is locat=ed such that ERCOT is and will be consistently telling the plant via its QS=E to provide OOMC -- to produce energy going north on a line in South Texas=. Doug says we should advocate to the PUC that plants in such a position sh=ould be Reliability Must Run (""RMR"") and be paid at an adequate premium for= their support of the system  reliability.I noted to you as well that this is likely to be a dispute with ERCOT over =the interpretation of the Protocols, conducted under Protocols Section 20, =and we would appreciate any reg. group efforts toward preparation for iinit=iating such dispute.  Frontera has indicated they will not provide OOMC tom=orrow even if ERCOT tells us, their QSE that it should be dispatched. Thus =we are caught in the middle.  The legitimate bases for not complying with a=n ERCOT dispatch instruction are stated in Protocols Section 5.4.4(2): ""thr=eat to safety, risk of bodily harm or damage to the equipment, or otherwise= is not in compliance with these Protocols"".  Though the Protocols Sections= 1-22 seem to recognize as to other capacity- oriented ancillary service pr=oducts that it is  generating capacity available but not energy delivered t=o the grid , I have not seen this made clear as to OOMC.  The Operating Gui=des  definition of OOMC, page 21 seems to recognize this however, and Secti=on 2B of the ERCOT Market Guide, p. 8 (Feb 22, 2001) recognizes the distinc=tion between capacity and generated energy clearly in support of the positi=on stated by John Forney below.=20Sorry for the long e-mail -- I was trying to provide a statting point for y=our group.  -----Original Message-----From: =09Forney, John M. =20Sent:=09Wednesday, November 14, 2001 12:27 PMTo:=09Portz, David; Gilbert-smith, DougSubject:=09Ercot QuestionsDavid,I need some help with an Ercot protocol interpretation:Frontera has been issued  OOMC requests by the ISO on numerous occasions, s=tarting September 14th.    This Out of Merit request is issued if no mkt bi=ds exist to solve congestion, whether local or zonal.The OOMC, as I understand it,  reserves capacity for Ercot and the premium =is predetermined based on a formula mentioned in the protocols.   The formu=la is based on the replacement reserve clearing price,  which currently is =zero.   This is because the replacement reserve market is non-existent.  An= announcement on how the OOMC capacity payments will be calculated is due o=ut this week,  per Mark Patterson.The second component of this option is OOME.    This is a request for actua=l energy related to the OOMC option.   The strike price is calculated from =a preset heat rate multiplied by the HSC daily price, as mentioned in the p=rotocols.  So the OOMC/OOME ws designed to work like the ancillary services= with a capacity award and an energy component.  I think that this is the s=pirit of the OOM s, as mentioned in Section 6 of the Protocols.  =20Here is the problem:the head of Ercot Market Operations,  John Adams,  interprets the protocols= to mean that OOMC requries the plant to be generating.     When Ercot disp=atchers had issued an OOMC,  they quickly followed up to ask us why we were= not generating into the grid.We explained to them, on numerous occasions,  that we dont believe OOMC mea=ns run.   If they wanted us to run,  then they would need to issue an OOME =for the actual energy component.    I asked my employees to clarify with Er=cot whether we were being asked to run,  yes or no.    When instructed to r=un by Ercot,  we had to assume that we were settled based upon the OOME cal=c, as we were previously under OOMC orders.I sent at least three e-mails to my Ercot rep,  Mark Patterson regarding th=is issue.   I finally caught him by phone and he relayed that he thought Er=cot s  intrepretation was correct.    For all of the times that we ran,  at= their request,  we werent going to be paid based on the OOME heat rate cal=c,  rather we were going to receive the balancing energy price ( a penalty =for Resource Imbalance).   For example,  in the early morning hours we woul=d receive as little as $1 for electricity that cost $27 to generate.   Mark= also mentioned that when they said run,  they expected us to sell to someo=ne else,  or just generate into the imbalance.    Mark told me ""dont worry,=  you can file to receive your generation expenses in the event that you lo=st money.""Here is my view:OOMC does not mean run.  It means have the capacity available in the event =Ercot calls,  much like replacement,  responsive reserve and non-spinning.Ercot s interpretation is being decided by the Manager of Mkt Operations,  =a group supposedly unconcerned with price.If OOMC means to run,  then why would the protocols contemplate, or need OO=ME?  They would never have to pay OOME if we were already running into the =imbalance.OOMC is an option and the exercise is OOME.   This is basically the disagre=ement.    This could very well be a $500,000 issue for Frontera.Why would anyone generate for $27 and dump to the imbalance mkt at $5 in ho=pes of filing for a ""breakeven.""   Ridiculous.I spoke with Bill Kettlewell with Customer Relations and he had ""no comment="" on whether OOMC means to generate.  Mark Patterson now also has ""no comme=nt.""Bill and Mark said that we needed to file a dispute in order to receive clo=sure on the OOM capacity payment.   I suspect that we will follow this same= path when we file for OOME reimbursement vs.  the imbalance price we will =receive.I had instructed my employeess to refuse to turn on the plant   (in respons=e to an OOMC) until we receive an OOME instruction.   This has compelled  E=rcot to deploy an OOME request to us, because they need  to have us online =to control local congestion.   Would this not be an omission that their vie=w was incorrect?  Section 5.4.4 says that a QSE may fail to comply with an =Ercot directive if it causes a safety concern, or ,  Ercot is not in compli=ance with the Protocols.  The latter is in effect.Ercot is now telling us that they cannot instruct us, or give us an OOME de=ployment,  unless we are already runnnig.    I think that this is a softwar=e issue, not a protocol issue.  =20We worked out an interim compromise with Ercot until this issue can be sett=led.  Once we have been OOMC d,  we will start to gen.   Once we reach full= load,  we will request an OOME.   If they dont comply,  we will shut down =the unit.    Ercot said that "" it was entirely reasonable that we would  re=quest to be compensated in the form of an OOME.""The Ercot dispatchers are complaining that OOME requires them to send an in=struction every 15 minutes.   Is this why we are not getting the OOME instr=uction on a regular basis?Finally,  I stressed to Ercot that I wasnt trying to manipulate prices, via= OOME or force Ercot into a corner.    It just is not the right economic en=vironment to generate for $27 and sell for $5.    Further,  operations pers=onell at Ercot have frelayed their displeasure with me for ""forcing them to= OOME our plant.""Can I get an opinion on whether OOMC means to run?   If you agree with me, = what is our next step?  I need to move aggressively on this issue.Thanks,JForney37160"

So the only way to adjust it is to go and do it in theportal.2.  Also if you have a day ahead position and we manage it hourly,if we wereto adjust it for balday, for instance if we were long 50mw in the pool andwe sold 25mw balday it would reflect the change.  But if we came back anddid another trade and submitted to xml it would change back to 50mw.3.  We need to change how we show a buy from frontera.  We now have to buyfrom frontera and then sale back to them.  This was a way to fix the problemshort term but it should not be a long term solution.4.  And ettera is still very time consuming.

Another unit specific instruction orOOME would be required for the unit to actually run at 50MW.As recent as this morning, we were told that ERCOT would provide us anOOME instruction when they want us to run after an OOMC instruction.However, they also said that we were operating outside the protocols dueto John Adams  interpretation that when we receive an OOMC for a certaintime period at a certain level we should be generating.We need immediate clarification on this issue.**********************************************************************This e-mail is the property of Enron Corp. and/or its relevant affiliateand may contain confidential and privileged material for the sole use ofthe intended recipient (s).

51644,2001-11-07 05:36:46,"I need some support on this:For the last two weeks,  Ercot has been giving us OOMC orders.     They have told us to run the plant, without question.     We have asked them whether they mean OOME when we run.    To a man,   the Ercot dispatch guys have said that OOMC means to run, they want the power.     I have launched three e-mails (requesting clarification)  to Mark Patterson,  starting weeks ago on this issue.    Yesterday,   I caught Mark by phone at 5:30pm.Mark consulted with his operations group and determined that we had been OOMC d and we should run,  but they are not going to pay us the hr calc.They said that OOMC means run and we are supposed to sell this power.     This confusion on our part will prove costly to Frontera as they will be paid the imbalance, instead of the heat rate calc.       We cannot sell in the offpeak hours for greater than $5.      It costs us $26 to generate power.Mark said "" dont worry, at worst case you can file for reimbursement.""     Mark also said that we will get paid for the capacity. But what???It is my opinion that it is no accident that Ercot was vague on this issue.     They want to penalize us if we dont run,  and if we do ,  we will lose money.We then file to get a break-even rebate.  They are acquiring ancillary reserves for free and not even paying for the energy component.I realize that these issues will be discussed in the Tuesday meeting and I will provide examples, as requested by Ercot.I need some support from the protocols and I need some suggestions.   I  do not want to allow these guys to game us anymore.  We will be more vocal in this meeting.    If no resolution is reached,  I vote for ignoring their OOM instructions.I need a ruling on whether they can force us to lose money.  Thanks,JForney"

Do we have any interests that would warrant more than a plain intervention?  Let me know if you want a copy of the original filing, with maps, etc.INSIDE FERC-October 29, 2001WILLIAMS PUTS MEAT ON THE BONES OF WESTERN FRONTIER PROJECT DESIGNTouting a need for more pipeline capacity linking the ""prolific"" supply basins of the central Rockiesand increasingly hungry Mid-Continent markets, The Williams Cos. Inc. last week took the next step byfiling for authorization to build and operate the Western Frontier project.The sponsor has in hand four negotiated-rate deals for long-term service covering roughly two-thirdsof the 540,000 Dt/day of project design capacity, it told FERC in an Oct. 24 certificate application(CP02-11). Williams wants to have the $366 million project up and running by Nov. 1, 2003; itasked the commission to issue a final certificate by Dec. 11, 2002, so that it can commence constructionby the following April.Williams unveiled initial plans for Western Frontier early last summer (IF, 9 July, 14) and held an openseason in June and July. To carry gas from the Power River, Big Horn, Wind River and Green River basins- estimated to hold 173 Tcf of potential and recoverable reserves - the new 30-inch-diameter mainlinewould run 398 miles, starting at the Cheyenne Hub and ending at an interconnection with the system ofaffiliate Williams Gas Pipelines Central Inc. in Beaver County, Okla. Characterizing the Cheyenne Hub as""a liquid point of supply,"" Williams asserted that ""presently, supply capability to the hub has outpacedtransportation capacity away from the hub to market areas due to insufficient pipeline infrastructure.""Along the way, the Western Frontier mainline would make another interconnection with WilliamsCentral as well as with Northern Natural Gas Co., ANR Pipeline Co., Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of Americaand Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Co., ""thus providing multiple avenues for gas produced in the centralRockies to be transported throughout the Mid-Continent using the existing pipeline grid.""To ""further enhance its supply options,"" the sponsor wants to build a 9.7-mile lateral from themainline to the Wattenberg gas processing plant east of Denver to tap the Denver-Julesberg basin. Roundingout the project design are two new compressor stations, the 10,000-horsepower Chalk Bluff station tobe constructed at the Cheyenne Hub and the 20,000-hp Denver station to be built in Adams County, Colo.Following the open season, Williams hammered out precedent agreements with Marathon Oil Co.(75,000 Dt/day), Williams Energy Marketing and Trading Co. (200,000 Dt/day), Utilicorp United Inc.(15,000 Dt/day) and Entergy Power Generation Corp. (75,000 Dt/day). The initial term for the deals is 10years, except for Marathon which committed to a five-year term with an option to extend it an additionaltwo years, said the application.""Other shippers have expressed serious interest for the remaining capacity on Western Frontier, andactive negotiations are moving forward with these potential shippers,"" said the application, adding thatWilliams was ""confident . . . that the remaining capacity will be committed in the upcoming months.""With the addition of compression, the project could ""facilitate relatively inexpensive expansions toaccommodate future market growth,"" the sponsor told FERC. And that may well be necessary, it continued,pointing to ""stagnant to declining supply"" in the Mid-Continent basins coupled with ""projected demandincreases."" As in many areas of the country, ""much of the anticipated demand increase is attributed toinstallation and operation of . . . gas-fired electrical generation,"" it said. The 11,439 Mw of ""active wintergenerating capacity"" in the combined service areas of Western Frontier and Williams Central is expected tomore than double by 2004, said Williams.The application seeks negotiated rate authority for the project operator, Western Frontier PipelineCo. LLC, and approval of initial recourse rates. The maximum daily reservation rate under schedule FTSwould be 35?/Dt for contract demand in Zone 1 and 79.4?/Dt in Zone 2.Under the negotiated deals reached with the four ""anchor"" shippers, Utilicorp and Entergy would pay acombined reservation and commodity rate of 25?/Dt at a 100% load factor for Zone 1 service to theWilliams Central Hugoton station in Kansas, while WEM&T would pay a combined rate of 30?/Dt forZone 2 transportation to the Williams Central system in Oklahoma and Marathon would pay 32?/Dt underthe shorter contract for Zone 2 service to interconnects with ANR, Panhandle and Williams Central inOklahoma. All transportation would originate at the Cheyenne Hub."

53510,2001-11-02 08:17:37,"Another wrinkle in the El Paso/CPUC Complaint case.  I ve also attached a copy of the El Paso Merchant answer to the FERC enforcement staff motion in case you re interested.NGI s Daily Gas Price Index published : November 2, 2001El Paso Seeks to Derail Further Market Power Investigation The motion by the enforcement staff of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for a ""more complete investigation"" of unused capacity on the system of El Paso Natural Gas is ""an abuse of process,"" the pipeline and its merchant energy affiliate claimed Thursday, since it comes after the case has been fully litigated. In filing a motion to strike the enforcement staff s request for the investigation, El Paso Natural Gas and El Paso Merchant Energy said the staff motion is a violation of their due process rights, since an initial decision in the case was issued three weeks ago (see Daily GPI, Oct. 10 <http://intelligencepress.com/subscribers/daily/news/d20011010c.html>). At that time Chief Administrative Law Judge Curtis Wagner Jr. recommended the dismissal of charges that El Paso and its affiliate exercised market power to drive up prices for gas transported to the border beginning in mid-2000 [RP00-241]. The judge had concluded that the complainants in the case failed to carry their burden of proof that the El Paso companies exercised market power by withholding capacity from the market. After the parties file briefs on the ALJ s decision, all that remains is a vote by the commissioners, the El Paso companies pointed out. The investigation sought by the Market Oversight and Enforcement Section (MOE) of the Office of General Counsel ""seeks to improperly shift the burden of proof by requiring El Paso and Merchant Energy to prove that they did not withhold capacity. This argument turns the Commission s adjudicatory procedures -- and its procedural safeguards -- on their head,"" the companies said. ""MOE is attempting to inappropriately influence the decision-making process in this already high profile case,"" putting the integrity of FERC s adjudicatory process in jeopardy. ""The rules under which the complaint is to be judged have become a moving target, El Paso s and Merchant Energy s due process rights and reputation have been harmed, and they have been put in the untenable position of now trying to prove a negative. MOE s improper comments should be disregarded and stricken from the record in this proceeding,"" the companies said. MOE said the issue it was raising -- whether El Paso made its unused capacity available to shippers on an IT basis, as required by FERC s open-access rule -- was neither the focus of the hearing last summer nor Wagner s initial decision (see Daily GPI, Nov. 1) <http://intelligencepress.com/subscribers/daily/news/d20011101d.html>.. MOE said its review of the public portion of the hearing record suggests that El Paso may have committed ""potential violations"" of FERC s Part 284 open-access regulations by withholding IT capacity in an attempt to keep prices up at the California border, but it said there may be ""other potential explanations"" for the existence of unused capacity on the pipeline. ""We recommend a more complete investigation of the reasons why capacity went unused on the pipeline at times during the period [of] November 2000 through March 2001."" MOE conceded its motion was an ""unusual"" move. It suggested that the Commission either direct MOE to conduct a further probe, remand the decision to Judge Wagner for consideration or use other procedures. Although ""this step is unusual, it is not unprecedented for the Commission s enforcement staff to inform the Commission of its views regarding potential violations concerning a pending proceeding,"" MOE said. El Paso pointed to a statement by the judge to back up its claim that parties in the proceeding had agreed that the pipeline was full from November through March.

Option (2) may be enough to give the comfort to ""concerned"" participants.	Option (3) and (4) will ensure that any letter we send out will make its way into the press, almost as soon as it is sent and if we send any such letter out we need to be prepared to meet any media interest. Further, the publication of any such letter in the press may encourage other counterparties in other forum to demand that EPMI and/or EES post bonds in order to continue trading and could materially adversely affect our trading activities.	If we considered that any disclosure would make a material difference to the confidence that NEPOOL participants have in trading with EPMI and/or EES, my recommendation would be to pursue Option (2).Marcus	 "

He is getting a large volume of calls from NEPOOL Participants concerned about Enron Corp s credit rating.  He is telling these Participants that his office only monitors whether NEPOOL members EPMI and EES are in compliance with the NEPOOL Financial Assurance Policy, which they are, and does not monitor Enron Corp.  Ed suggested that when PG&E experienced difficulties PG&E drafted a short notice, which ISO-NE circulated, explaining how its subsidiaries were not affected by the credit rating of the parent.  The ISO is offering us the same opportunity to draft and circulate something similar if we wish.What may be going on here is a concern by NEPOOL Participants that we are using a parent guaranty to meet the Financial Assurance Policy.  My recollection, however, is that we have instead posted surety bonds from AA agencies to meet NEPOOL credit requirements.  If we disclosed this to the NEPOOL Participants it might allay their credit concerns.  We may however, not want to disclose this if we are employing parent guarantees elsewhere, lest we be asked to post surety bonds everywhere.  Can you discuss this with the traders and see what they want to do?"

It was however recognised that there were difficulties in interpreting what was intended by the proposed RTO s and the relationship with the current Into Cinergy market.	AEP viewed that purchase of transmission was the critical area, who had to purchase what and several scenarios to work through. Whether Seller buys a wheel, whether buyer buys a wheel, or under MISO both parties buy a  wheel. This clearly has knock on effect for obligations in respect of firm and non-firm transmission and curtailment. In particular, what if non-firm is elected and how this flows through into obligations of the parties to a transaction.	Perception that the framework prepared by AEP will start all interested parties in the same place to talk about the issues. 	It was agreed to try to get a representative from Duke to join the next call as they were an Into Cinergy product trader as well.

Apparently, when the guy came in to set up the phone for the call,Small told him not to do it and sent him out.  I also agree that there seemsto be little regard for the bylaws; ""informality"" is being used to runroughshod over dissent.Since we had a representative present (without me, his attorney), weprobably lack standing to make a formal demand that the votes be rescindeduntil reintroduced under required conditions.  Otherwise, this e-mail wouldbe asking you to join us.  However, as many involved on our end were quiteupset, ""disenfranchisement"" could well become a matter for judicial reviewif it happens again to PacifiCorp.I remain amazed that Small would push for revisions, such as those to 32.5,knowing there was substantial question over their legal effect.  If indeedSmall s wrong on the law, we d be fully prepared to demand undoing thesechanges due to flawed legal advice from Small and ""passage"" out ofcompliance with the bylaws, and to do so jointly with others.  In fact, if Iget management okay, I d be willing to write a joint objection to file withFERC in response to the introduced amendments.  There may even be somecorporate doctrine under Utah law that prevents a non-profit from paying forSmall s defense in an internecine dispute.Although you are right that now is not the time for a joint WSPP/EEIdrafting committee, I very much like the idea of proposing one under coverof a memo that picks out the highlights of convergence after the EEI processstarted against the type of amendments that were made before the EEI was onthe table as a dramatic way to make the point that Small s agenda is todrive WSPP towards competition in a niche filled by the EEI, and hammer onthe other points you ve made, with which we fully agree.  I don t know thatthere s a need to do the convergence analysis exhaustively and academically,as opposed to persuasively, unless if you think you can convince a law student on a local law review that it would make a good note.I also note from the minutes that a Board of Trustees was elected; I do notrecall being provided with a copy of the slate of nominees in advance of themeeting.  I admit I didn t spend a lot of time puzzling over it, but I don tsee from the website or the bylaws the authority under which Small conductsthe committee meetings.

I agree with you that there seems to be a lack of basic dueprocess going on, but, it has always been difficult to understand howand why they do things the way they do.  History and personality seem toexplain it best. Right near the end of the Thursday session, I believe it was JeremyWeinstein of PacifiCorp, tried to focus Mike on what to me seems to be acrucial, and potentially fruitful question:  Is the WSPP becoming moreand more like the EEI, and if so, does anybody care?  Mike seemed tofeel that there was a vast difference between the two agreements andthat this vast difference mattered a lot.  I think if anybody would takethe time to dispassionately examine the steady stream of changes thathave been made to the WSPP over the past couple of years, the resultwould be that the two agreements would be seen to be converging ratherthan diverging. I would even take a further step and argue that theconvergence has been so steady and effective, that the time has nowarrived for a Joint EEI/WSPP Drafting Committee to harmonize theagreements. However, I think my suggestion is still premature.  At thismoment in the process, it would seem that a comparative document,painstakingly showing each amendment of the WSPP agreement and what itlooked like in comparison to the EEI needs to be created.  Ifconvergence is what this objective study shows, then, at some point, thequestion fairly becomes:  why not get it over with and merge thedocuments?  Is a Joint Drafting Committee a good idea?I may be wrong, and an academic look at my thesis is certainly required,but my instinct is that Mike s notion that a group-adopted agreement isfundamentally different than multiple bilateral agreements is a classicdistinction without a difference.  Why does how the agreement is derivedmatter if the two agreements are becoming inexorably more and morealike? Why should I fly up and down the west coast attending a steadystream of meetings and pay $25K a year to use one agreement when it issteadily becoming more and more like the other agreement which involvesneither inconvenience?  The creeping imitation of the WSPP process needsto be recognized for what it is.I would argue that this approach might bear more fruit than wranglingover process, although, that too is probably going to be an enduringnecessity. ----cgy-----Original Message-----From: Stack, Shari [mailto:SStack@reliant.com]Sent: Wednesday, November 07, 2001 12:19 PMTo: esager@enron.com; cyoder@enron.com; Russo, Dianne H;jeremy.weinstein@pacificorp.comSubject: FW: Summary of WSPP Nov 1 and 2 meetingsI don t know who has had time to read the latest WSPP email  - but theprovision below was NOT adopted in accordance with std. procedure.

I appreciate the help of Fino and Guillermo.  The credit worthiness in Alberta determines the trading limits for each participant in relation to its bond rating as follows: Rating		trading limitAAA		$25,000,000AA		$20,000,000A		$15,000,000BBB		$10,000,000<BBB		$0Trading limit is a defined term and means the maximum financial obligation to which a participant is or is expected to be owing the pool administrator.   I am currently investigating of the current levels of our trading levels as that will determine the action required.  If a participant s financial obligations are expected to exceed the trading limit , the participant must provide a payment in advance or other form of financial security.  This security may be in the form of a bank guarantee, letter of guarantee, irrevocable letter of credit, or cash deposits drawn on a Canadian Chartered Bank, trust company, credit union or other lending institution acceptable to Council in or for an amount determined by the pool administrator to be equal to the expected financial obligations in excess of the trading limit.It is noteworthy that a rating with a plus or minus sign indicates the relative standing within the major rating categories (so A- is A).  An exception to this is a rating of BBB minus which falls in the <BBB category and therefore no unsecured credit is granted.  It is also noteworthy that participants are required to report any downgrading of the relevant corporate credit rating within 2 business days.The Power Pool of Alberta requires participants to report any event of default for borrowed funds or a material adverse change in their financial position within 2 business days of said default or change.

We had proposed to them what Kevin had suggested, and they said their view on pricing in Virginia is slightly different (at a discount to PJM/VAP as against a premium suggested by us).  They d requested we send them some discussion points from our meeting today, so we can continue our discussions on an ongoing basis. Please review the bullet-point summary of our discussions last week, and the draft proposal.  We would appreciate your quick comments - but keep in mind, this is just to stimulate further discussions with them. Our overall objective is to migrate them to a new contract and away from their rights to audit the last few years.Discussion summary:Both parties agree that the contract needs to be revised to reflect current market conditions (pricing, liquidated damages, etc.).Enron would retain flexibility around the physical delivery points.VEPCO would like to continue treating this as a call option (versus a firm delivery).Settlement:  Would prefer the Day-Ahead index versus the hourly indexCould also look at another PJM West index - VAP/AlleghanyWill look at alternate times for calling on power, if necessaryWould like to renegotiate by 12/01/01 Rahil"

Plaintiffs are now pressing for a deposition on December 5 of a Rule 30(b)(6) corporate representative of TW in this matter in Houston at Susman, Godfrey s office.  You have already sent to me a list of contracts that might be relevant.  	Bill Rapp got a telefax just recently on this from a Wes Hahn, who is apparently acting as a consultant/expert in this case for defendants.  Hahn has suggested that he appear as TW s corporate rep in this matter.  Hahn advises that he was an officer of TW and Enron ""at the time that this contract was in force and when it was terminated.""  I guess he means the processing contract between plaintiffs and Chevron that was terminated around 1996 when Chevron sold the Leedey plant to Dynegy.	Let s talk tomorrow about how many contracts we have, how long they might take to review for privileges, etc., who would be the right corporate representative for TW, and so forth.  If you can think of anyone else who should be involved, please let me know.	Given that Becky Zikes has actually worked for TW some years ago as a contract administrator, I m going to ask her to attend our conference, as well as Barbara O Banion, who just recently joined the Unit as a contract legal assistant.	I look forward to speaking with you tomorrow.	Britt	P.S.:  Dari, I included you because a processing plant was involved and thought you might be interested.  Do you want to be kept in the loop?"

(The SLA Settlement reduces the rates that have been in effect since June, 2001, but it doesn t roll them back  to the RP98-302 rate case rates.)The timing & process will be similar to what we did in August, 1999.I would put the revised rates into TRS right after the February Commodity Invoices go out (around 3/12).The rates will be effective back to 11/1/2001.  We will repath 4 months with several iterations to check discounts and adjust manuals.Fuel is unaffected.  Storage contracts shouldn t be affected, either.We will use the February Commodity PPA cycle for the Commodity part of the refund.We will use the March Reservation PPA for the Reservation part of the refund.We would probably mail the refund PPA invoices at the end of March, just before the March Reservation Invoices go out on April 1.The refund dollars would hit the 3/2002 GL.If we follow the same plan as 8/99, then commodity PPAs will be shut off after the current, 1/2002 commodity invoices.Any non-SLA related PPAs would have to wait until the March Commodity invoice cycle in April.If there are pending PPAs that need to be released in this invoice cycle, it would be a good idea to do so.I ll resurrect the August, 1999 schedule and modify it later in the week.  Then, we can schedule a preliminary meeting to figure out what needs to happen.If someone protests the SLA order in the next month, this schedule would be delayed, but we should probably start getting things in place."

Enron said its cash Friday had fallen to $1.2-bil, even with the Dynegy payment three days earlier, $550-mil drawn on a new bank line last week and $3-bil drawn on existing lines earlier this month to pay off $1.9-bil of commercial paper. Enron blamed operating costs, trade settlements and collateral deposits paid to trading partners. Enron said it expects $800-mil soon from asset sales and got another $440-mil bank line Monday. But it warned it might not be enough to keep its investment-grade credit rating or restructure debt coming due. That could have a ""material adverse impact on Enron s ability to continue as a going concern,"" it warned.

Bryson Hull    HOUSTON, Nov 19 (Reuters) - Humbled energy giant Enron Corp. <ENE.N> on Monday warned that it could be forced to pay a $690 million debt by next week and reduced its already-abysmal third-quarter earnings.    The Houston company sounded the debt and credit alarms once again in a filing made on Monday with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.    Among the new information included is the disclosure that Enron is up against a short deadline to meet a $690 million debt obligation triggered by a credit downgrade last week.   That marked the start of a nine-day period that expires on Nov. 26, during which Enron must lay down collateral against the debt owed to a third party in one of its myriad partnerships.    If not, the partner has the right to liquidate all of the assets of the partnership, which includes a Brazilian natural gas company that Enron was counting on selling to raise $250 million in cash.    The company is working to make alternative payment arrangements, since it can ill-afford to pay the debt now. Enron has already already maxed out its $3 billion credit line, secured roughly $2 billion in loans and is looking for more cash to stay afloat.    Enron also reduced previously reported 2001 third-quarter earnings by 3 cents per share and increased previously reported earnings for the first 9 months of the year by a penny per share. The move reflects adjustments made after the quarter s end, Enron said.    On Oct. 16, Enron reported a loss of $638 million or 84 cents per share for the third quarter of 2001. On Nov 8, Enron said it had restated earnings for 1997-2000 and that net income for the four-year period was more than a half a billion lower than originally reported.    It also warned that a further drop in its credit rating could force it to pay $3.9 billion to other partnerships, the bulk of it to Osprey Trust and Marlin Water Trust.    Such an outcome would keep Enron from paying its revolving credit accounts and ""would likely have a material adverse impact on Enron s ability to continue as a going concern,"" the company wrote.    Enron had released those figures earlier, but had yet to state in such stark terms the dire risk the debts pose to its viability.    CREDIT COULD BE A KILLER    Moody s Investors Service and Standard & Poor s this month cut their respective senior unsecured debt ratings for Enron to ""Baa3"" and ""BBB-minus,"" just one notch above ""junk"" status. Each warned it may cut its respective ratings again. Moody s also cut Enron s short-term debt rating, which affects  commercial paper, to ""Not Prime,"" a junk rating.    In nearly all of its partnership deals, Enron guaranteed the financing it received with a promise to issue Enron shares to its partners if its credit fell below investment grade and its stock price was under certain levels. At the close of trading Monday on the New York Stock Exchange, Enron shares were at $9.06 - well below the trigger prices.    All of the partnerships, which Enron used to finance projects in a way that kept them off the balance sheet, have become the once-proud company s bane. The SEC is investigating potential conflict-of-interest issues involving two such partnerships on which ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow served as general partner.    Enron had to extract itself from those partnerships, which led to a $1.2 billion reduction in Enron shareholder equity.    The revelation of the equity reduction started one of the more stunning and rapid corporate collapses in recent memory, leaving Enron to be bought on Nov. 9 by smaller cross-town rival Dynegy Inc. <DYN.N> for the fire-sale price of $9 billion in stock.    In an unusual note, Enron said that its financial statements in the filing were not audited by an independent accountant, per SEC regulations, because of ""the need of Arthur Andersen LLP, Enron s independent auditors, to complete their review procedures.""    Arthur Andersen had no comment, but Enron said the ongoing investigation by a special committee appointed by Enron s board of directors to look into its partnership dealings precludes the audit s completion.

It is a sign that investors are willing to pay a rich price f=or option protection and expect the stock to be unsettled as the Houston co=mpany sorts through its credit and debt problems and seeks to calm frazzled= investors.=20Enron near-month defensive puts traded heavily in an otherwise quiet sessio=n Wednesday, as investors bought them to hedge. The December 5 puts traded =more than 10,000 contracts and jumped 45 cents to $1.10 at the Chicago Boar=d Options Exchange. The stock closed down $1.98, or 28%, to $5.01, as of 4 =p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.Enron s calls traded actively as some investors sold them to generate incom=e. Traders noted some call buying -- especially after Enron procured a thre=e-week extension on a $690 million note -- as some hopeful investors bet on= Enron pulling through its troubles and proceeding with its merger with Dyn=egy Inc. Enron s December 5 calls traded more than 14,500 contracts, compar=ed with open interest of 710, as they fell $1.45 to $1.15 at the CBOE.=20For investors who want to book a tax loss on beaten-down stocks, the ""wash =sale"" rule can be a hurdle, because it essentially prevents taxpayers from =selling stock or securities at a loss and then reacquiring ""substantially i=dentical"" securities within a 30-day period before or after that loss. This= poses a problem for those who want to book a loss yet own stocks whose pri=ces now make them attractive ""buy"" candidates.=20In addition, the Internal Revenue Service has taken the position that the w=ash-sale rule will disallow a loss if the investor sells an in-the-money pu=t, because there is a strong likelihood that stock will be put to or acquir=ed by the investor.=20So investors typically get around the wash-sale rule by ""doubling up"": buyi=ng additional stock or options, waiting at least 31 days, and then selling =the original stock to book the loss. Investors double up by buying calls, w=hich locks a price to buy stock and achieves the same effect as buying addi=tional stock.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. =09Dynegy Deal To Buy Enron Hits CrossroadsBy Rebecca Smith and John R. EmshwillerStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal11/23/2001The Wall Street JournalA3(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)Even as it reiterated its intention to purchase Enron Corp., Dynegy Inc. is= coming under increasing pressure to renegotiate or walk away from the mult=ibillion-dollar deal.=20The pressure is stemming from the continuing slide in the price of Enron sh=ares and the mounting financial problems at the Houston energy-trading comp=any, the nation s biggest marketer of electricity and natural gas. During t=he past month, Enron has taken a $1 billion write-off of assets, revised do=wnward the earnings of the past several years and taken a $1.2 billion redu=ction in shareholder equity.The problems have been due largely to dealings Enron had with private partn=erships, run by some of its own executives, under investigation by the Secu=rities and Exchange Commission. In an SEC filing Monday, Enron disclosed hu=ndreds of millions of potential additional write-offs as well as the possib=ility that its weakening financial condition could force it to repay more t=han $2 billion in loans by the end of the year.=20As of 4 p.m. Wednesday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron =shares fell $1.98, or 28%, to $5.01 each after having dropped 23% Tuesday. =In excess of 115 million shares traded Wednesday, more than four times the =volume of any other Big Board stock. Enron s bonds also again traded sharpl=y lower, market observers said.=20The turmoil spilled over to Dynegy s stock, which also was among the most a=ctively traded on the New York Stock Exchange. As of 4 p.m. Wednesday, Dyne=gy shares fell $1.94 to $39.76 each.=20On Wednesday, Dynegy issued a statement in which Chairman and Chief Executi=ve Chuck Watson said his company was working ""to accelerate the regulatory =approvals required to complete the merger in accordance with the previously= announced agreement"" though it continued to perform ""due diligence"" on Enr=on.=20Under the merger agreement, Dynegy has opportunities to renegotiate or walk= away from the deal if Enron s financial and legal problems become severe e=nough. However, some observers said it can be difficult to invoke these so-=called material adverse change clauses. They point to a decision earlier th=is year by a Delaware Chancery Court judge who forced Tyson Foods Inc. to c=omplete a planned purchase of IBP Inc. even though Tyson, a Springdale, Ark=., food-products company, had wanted to cancel the transaction because of a= drop in IBP s earnings and accounting problems at an IBP unit.=20Dynegy officials didn t return calls seeking comment. To complete the deal,= two-thirds of Dynegy shareholders and a majority of Enron shareholders wou=ld have to give their approval. No dates for those votes have been set.=20One person familiar with the merger plans said the SEC filing Monday by Enr=on contained information Dynegy hadn t known about. Dynegy representatives =planned to work through the weekend evaluating the importance of this new i=nformation as part of the company s due diligence, this person said. It cou=ldn t be determined what the new information was.=20The merger agreement, announced Nov. 9, calls for Dynegy to exchange 0.2685= share for each of Enron s roughly 850 million fully diluted shares, giving= the purchase a value of about $9 billion at Dynegy s current stock price. =However, from a price standpoint, the deal is appearing less attractive to =Dynegy.=20On the day of the merger announcement, Enron shares were trading at about $=8.63 each, or about 83% of the purchase price under the exchange ratio. As =of Wednesday, Enron s market price was only about 47% of the merger-formula= price. Such a sharp deterioration is unusual following a merger announceme=nt, when the stock price of the company being acquired generally begins tra=ding relatively close to the offering price.=20Sentiment among Wall Street analysts also is turning against the merger. In=itially, many analysts lauded the merger as a move that would rescue Enron =and provide a major boost to Houston-based Dynegy. Dynegy and Enron officia=ls have predicted that the merger, supposed to be completed late next year,= would significantly and immediately increase Dynegy s earnings.=20Now analysts are challenging that assumption. Ron Barone, managing director= at UBS Warburg LLC, said he believes that because of Enron s financial pro=blems, a combined company would actually have lower earnings next year than= Dynegy would have by itself. Mr. Barone said he thinks a ""likely scenario""= is that the merger formula will be renegotiated sharply down to about 0.15= Dynegy share for each Enron share.=20Such a ratcheting down wouldn t be without precedent in the deal. According= to one person familiar with the merger negotiations, Dynegy reduced the ex=change formula at least once prior to the Nov. 9 announcement because of En=ron s rapidly sinking stock price, which at the beginning of this year was =above $80 a share.=20In perhaps the most significant sign of the turning tide on Wall Street, Go=ldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer lowered his ratings on Enron and Dynegy=. A longtime Enron fan, Mr. Fleischer issued a report expressing doubts tha=t the merger would help Dynegy s earnings and whether Enron could ""recover =the significant business that has been lost"" in its giant energy-trading op=erations. ""The Enron machine continues to sputter,"" Mr. Fleischer wrote.=20Some observers say that if Dynegy walked away from the deal or tried to ren=egotiate the terms significantly, Enron might be pushed into a bankruptcy-l=aw filing. Without the Dynegy acquisition and continued support from its ba=nkers and customers, an Enron bankruptcy-court filing ""is highly possible,""= said Ralph Pellecchia, a senior director at Fitch, a credit-ratings agency=. On Wednesday, Fitch maintained its credit rating on Enron at just one not=ch above noninvestment-grade, or ""junk,"" status. But Fitch also said it bel=ieved Enron s trading partners had made ""significant cash collateral calls""= in recent days that are ""well in excess of previous expectations,"" contrib=uting to ""liquidity pressures.""=20Among the advisers Enron has hired during its current crisis is the law fir=m of Weil, Gotshal & Manges, which specializes in bankruptcy and corporate-=workout situations. Asked about a possible bankruptcy filing, an Enron spok=eswoman said the company expects the Dynegy deal to go through and therefor=e doesn t expect to have to look at alternatives to the merger. Since the m=erger announcement, Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay has said his company had alt=ernatives to the Dynegy deal but he has declined to identify them. Enron sa=id it made some progress improving its financial position. The company said= it reached a final agreement with units of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Cit=igroup Inc. on the remaining $450 million of a previously announced $1 bill=ion in secured credit lines.

Amid growing disclosur=es of financial problems in recent weeks, the company ""locked down"" the ret=irement plan from Oct. 17 to Nov. 19 to make administrative changes, which =prevented employees from selling Enron shares as the share price collapsed.Enron, which recently agreed to be acquired by Dynegy Inc., Houston, becaus=e of mounting financial problems, has seen its stock price fall to $5.01 on= Wednesday from a peak of nearly $90 a share last year. The decline has bee=n costly to participants in Enron s retirement plan because more than 60% o=f the 401(k) assets were invested in Enron shares at the end of last year, =according to one of the suits.=20The first suit was filed Nov. 13 on behalf of plan participants by Campbell= Harrison & Wright LLP, a Houston law firm, and the second was filed Tuesda=y by Seattle-based Hagens Berman LLP. Both seek class-action certification.==20Enron said its corporate policy is not to comment on pending lawsuits. A sp=okeswoman also said the company s 401(k) plan offers participants 18 invest=ment choices, one of which is company stock.=20The company s stock has fallen amid mounting losses and disclosures that it= had extensive off-balance-sheet dealings with a web of partnerships headed= by former company officials. The Securities and Exchange Commission has la=unched a formal investigation into the company s accounting, and Enron has =said it will restate years of financial information.=20The suits against Enron are the latest of a series of suits filed against c=ompanies over losses in the company-stock portion of their 401(k) plans. Th=e suits allege the plan trustees breached their fiduciary duties by continu=ing to offer company stock, even after they became aware of serious busines=s problems that would hurt the stock price. All the suits are pending.=20As with most of these companies, Enron matches employee contributions to th=e 401(k) with shares of Enron stock, and also offers Enron stock as an inve=stment choice, in addition to a variety of mutual funds. About $1.3 billion= of the plan s $2.1 billion in assets was invested in Enron shares at the e=nd of 2000, according to the suit filed by Campbell Harrison.=20Pamela Tittle, a participant in the 401(k) plan who worked in the finance d=epartment and a named plaintiff in the Enron suit filed by Campbell Harriso=n & Wright, had roughly 2,000 shares of Enron stock in her retirement accou=nt and has suffered losses of about $140,000 as a result of the stock s dec=line. The suit alleges that the trustees of the Enron 401(k) plan violated =their fiduciary duties by not informing plan participants that the company =stock was in peril.=20The suit filed by Hagens Berman, also alleges that the company failed to wa=rn participants about risks of remaining invested in Enron stock. In additi=on, it accuses Enron of systematically misrepresenting its financial result=s since 1998 in connection with the partnerships under investigation by the= SEC.=20Roy E. Rinard, a lineman for Enron in Oregon who is a named plaintiff in th=e suit filed by Hagens Berman, has seen the value of his retirement plan fa=ll to $70,000 from $470,000, largely as a result of the decline in Enron s =stock. ""I feel like I have been betrayed,"" Mr. Rinard said in press release= issued by his lawyers. ""I lost my savings, my plans for the future, everyt=hing.""=20Under federal pension law, companies are allowed to offer their own stock i=n retirement plans, and are allowed to force employees to hold onto the sto=ck. Enron doesn t let employees diversify out of shares they receive as mat=ching contributions to the 401(k) plan until age 50.=20However, plan trustees are supposed to operate the plan in the best interes=ts of the participants, which includes choosing prudent investments. Genera=lly, to prove that the plan s administrators breached their fiduciary dutie=s, employees must show that the trustees knew the stock was a bad investmen=t. This presents a high hurdle, so it is not surprising that prior lawsuits= over losses in company stock in 401(k) plans have generally come in the wa=ke of allegations of accounting irregularities.=20Lynn Sarko, one of Ms. Tittle s attorneys with Seattle s Keller Rohrback LL=P, is also co-lead counsel in a similar lawsuit against Lucent Technologies= Inc., Murray Hill, N.J. Another firm representing Ms. Tittle is Dalton Got=to Samson & Kilgard PLC, which is lead counsel in a similar suit against Ik=on Office Solutions Inc., Malvern, Pa. The two law firms are representing M=s. Tittle with Campbell Harrison & Wright.=20The suits against Lucent and Ikon, like the suit against Enron, allege that= then-current plan trustees kept offering company stock in the plan despite= knowing of serious business problems that would hurt the stock price. Repr=esentatives for Ikon and Lucent say their companies didn t require employee=s to invest in the company stock, and educated employees about the need for= diversification.=20The suit in which Mr. Rinard is plaintiff notes that on Oct. 17, a day afte=r Enron announced the company was taking a nonrecurring charge totaling $1.=01 billion in the third quarter, Enron ""locked down"" the 401(k) plan s asse=ts, preventing participants from selling Enron shares. (A ""lock-down"" occur=s when a retirement plan is transferred from one administrator to another, =and generally lasts several weeks, during which time participants can t mak=e changes in their investment choices).=20The lock-down was lifted on Nov. 19. In the interim, on Nov. 8, Enron annou=nced it would be forced to restate downward its reported financial results =from 1997 through 2000. By the time the lock-down was lifted, as a result o=f all the negative news the shares had fallen to below $9 a share from $32.=20 on Oct. 17, when the lockup started, Hagens Berman attorney Karl Barth s=aid.=20""They were locked into it right when Enron knew it was going to be announci=ng some really bad news,"" Mr. Barth said. ""Mr. Rinard s looking at having n=o retirement savings now. It s a horrible thing to have to start over in yo=ur 50s.""Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The Securities =and Exchange Commission filed civil fraud complaints against the Andersen p=artner who audited Sunbeam and against the firm itself in the Waste Managem=ent case.=20Now Enron has repudiated the financial statements that were certified by Ar=thur Andersen, in the process shaving more than half a billion dollars from= the company s reported profits in recent years.All of which raises the question: Has Arthur Andersen become the black shee=p of the accounting industry?=20It is not an easy question to answer, and not everyone is willing to rush t=o judgment.   If you want to attack Andersen for Enron, you need to know mo=re than we know,   Arthur Levitt, the former chairman of the Securities and= Exchange Commission, said this week.=20But if there is a thread connecting what is known about the three cases, it= is materiality. In all three cases, Andersen auditors spotted bad accounti=ng but were persuaded it was immaterial and therefore allowed it to go ahea=d.=20Materiality is one of those flexible concepts that can get accountants into= trouble. The idea is that it doesn t much matter if a few little things we=re gotten wrong. But they can add up.=20At Enron, however, they did not add up to that much -- a total of $93 milli=on over four years. The biggest restatement of Enron profits concerns a rel=ated party that Enron now says should have been consolidated. It is not cle=ar if Andersen had the facts needed to make that decision at the time.=20To those who treasure the role of auditors, the humiliation of Andersen is =painful. Back in the 1950 s, it was Leonard Spacek, Andersen s managing par=tner, who warned that   the profession s existence is in peril   because it= was not showing enough independence. His public prodding was crucial in ma=king the industry do a better job. Two decades ago, when the issue on the t=able was pension accounting, Andersen was the only major accounting firm to= break with clients and push for good rules.=20Now Andersen s backbone is open to question. It was evidence that senior pe=ople at Andersen repeatedly gave in to pressure from Waste Management that =led the S.E.C. to bring that suit, which the firm chose to settle without a=dmitting it had done anything wrong. The partner that the S.E.C. says looke=d the other way at Sunbeam is fighting the accusations, and Andersen says h=e acted properly.=20Lynn Turner, who was chief accountant of the S.E.C. at the time and is now =director of the Center for Quality Financial Reporting at Colorado State Un=iversity, says what is happening to Andersen now is reminiscent of what hap=pened to Coopers & Lybrand when he was a partner there and the firm had a s=eries of highly publicized blown audits.=20  We got bludgeoned to death in the press,   he said.   People did not even= want to see us at their doorsteps. It was brutal, but we deserved it. We h=ad gotten into this mentality in the firm of making business judgment calls=.   By that he meant that the firm paid too much attention to not offending= clients and not enough to good accounting.=20For Andersen to avoid that fate, its relatively new chief executive, Joseph= Berardino, who declined to be interviewed for this column, will need to se=t a tone inside the firm making clear that he expects auditors to show the =backbone that Mr. Spacek epitomized. And then he will have to convince the =public of that.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. =09Business/Financial Desk; Section CChase and J. P. Morgan s Paper AnniversaryA Year After the Merger, Rosy Plans Meet RealityBy RIVA D. ATLAS11/23/2001The New York TimesPage 1, Column 5c. 2001 New York Times CompanyWhen William B. Harrison Jr. speaks of last year s $31 billion merger of J.= P. Morgan and the Chase Manhattan Corporation, he speaks proudly of a deal= that he considers to be a capstone to his 34-year career of helping build =a giant of the banking business.=20  This is the first merger I ve been part of,   said Mr. Harrison, the chie=f executive of the combined bank,   where I feel our core business is compl=ete.  The Chase-J. P. Morgan combination helped advance the bank into the investm=ent banking elite, just as Mr. Harrison intended. But with Wall Street and =the economy in far different places today than they were when the deal was =put together, the many mergers, stock sales and other money-making opportun=ities that were supposed to justify the high-priced acquisition have largel=y dried up for now.=20Consequently, deal makers and analysts who follow the bank are already spec=ulating that Mr. Harrison, 58, may ultimately be compelled to do yet anothe=r large deal, this time to diversify his business away from its heavy empha=sis on Wall Street.=20J. P. Morgan Chase has won some prominent assignments, like handling the re=vampings of troubled giants like Lucent and, more recently, Enron, the bele=aguered energy trading company.=20But while J. P. Morgan Chase is proud of serving alongside Citigroup as bot=h lead lender and adviser to Enron on its acquisition by Dynegy, the dual r=ole it has worked to achieve sometimes proves complicated for the bank. Wit=h Enron s shares in free fall as more information comes out about its hidde=n debts, J. P. Morgan Chase has been scrambling to maintain the support of =other banks while simultaneously keeping the merger with Dynegy on track.==20Thanks largely to the slump on Wall Street, J. P. Morgan Chase s profits fe=ll by two-thirds in the third quarter, to $449 million from $1.4 billion in= the period a year ago. Its stock has dropped 15 percent this year, more th=an other banks  shares. The bank s stock is ahead of investment banks like =Goldman Sachs, with which J. P. Morgan Chase increasingly competes.=20  The jury is still out in many respects on this merger,   said Judah Kraus=haar, an analyst at Merrill Lynch. Nevertheless, he likes J. P. Morgan Chas=e s stock, he said, because   expectations are very low.  =20All J. P. Morgan Chase s competitors are suffering from the slowdown on Wal=l Street. But some, like Citigroup, are better diversified and have greater= involvement in old-fashioned consumer banking, which is proving to be a st=rong moneymaker this year.=20Nearly a third of J. P. Morgan Chase s revenues are consumer-oriented. By c=ontrast, its chief New York rival, Citigroup, gets half its revenues from c=onsumer businesses.=20  The timing of the merger was bad,   said Steven Wharton, a banking analys=t at Loomis, Sayles & Company, which owns about a million J. P. Morgan Chas=e shares.   There s no disputing that.  =20Actually, Mr. Harrison disputes it.   I can t tell you how happy I am about= having done this merger,   he said in a recent interview.   While there ar=e pluses and minuses to operating in a weak economic environment, we have a= much stronger platform to manage with during this difficult time.  =20In Mr. Harrison s favor is his battle-tested team of top executives who hav=e worked together for a decade or more. Few executives remain in the top sp=ots from the old J. P. Morgan. Instead, most major posts are filled by mana=gers who have worked with Mr. Harrison since his days at Chemical Bank, whe=re he spent most of his career. Mr. Harrison s team successfully gobbled up= Manufacturers Hanover Bank in 1991, then followed that with Chemical s mer=ger with Chase Manhattan in 1996 before incorporating Morgan into the fold =last year.=20The group of Chemical veterans includes Marc J. Shapiro, who oversees finan=ce and risk management at J. P. Morgan Chase; Donald H. Layton, one of two =leaders of investment banking; and James B. Lee Jr., the bank s senior deal= maker. The team also includes Dina Dublon, the bank s chief financial offi=cer.=20Two other senior executives have also lived through big deals. Geoffrey T. =Boisi, the other investment banking leader, was the one-time investment ban=king chief at Goldman, Sachs. David A. Coulter, in charge of Chase s retail= bank, had been chief executive of Bank of America before it was bought by =NationsBank.=20  There aren t many teams that have gone through as many mergers as Bill Ha=rrison and his team,   said Mark G. Solow, managing principal at GarMark Ad=visors, an investment firm, and a former senior executive at Chemical.=20Still, Ms. Dublon acknowledged that the tough economy was making the J. P. =Morgan takeover more difficult than the earlier combinations.=20  In general, mergers are very hard on morale,   she said.   There is no qu=estion that this one has a tougher emotional toll.  =20The bank s executives are making the best of a bad situation. They have tak=en advantage of the slowdown to cut around 8 percent of the combined banks = staff, or about 2,500 more employees than anticipated at the time the merg=er was announced.=20Many of these job cuts were aimed at high-cost investment bankers: J. P. Mo=rgan Chase expects that 6,000 jobs in its investment banking division will =have been eliminated by the end of the year.=20  We have focused on the tougher jobs to cut,   Ms. Dublon said.=20In some ways the overall market turmoil has made it easier for J. P. Morgan= Chase to overhaul its staff. With fewer jobs available on Wall Street, Mr.= Shapiro said, the employees who are left behind are less apt to complain a=bout changes in their jobs.   People have fewer options,   he said,   so yo=u have a little more control over the process.  =20Thanks partly to these cuts, the bank estimates the saving from cost cuttin=g will be $3.6 billion annually, compared with an original projection of $2= billion at the time of the merger.=20The cost cutting has helped compensate somewhat for a sharp drop in profits= in the bank s core businesses.   What we can control and are managing very= aggressively is the expenses of the company,   Ms. Dublon said in a confer=ence call with reporters on Oct. 17, the day earnings were announced.=20Aside from cost cuts, the weakness on Wall Street makes it hard for the ban=k s executives to point to tangible gains in investment banking, where fees= were down 24 percent in the third quarter. But Mr. Harrison points to mark=et-share gains the bank has achieved at the expense of competitors on Wall =Street. He hopes that when the investment banking business revives, J. P. M=organ Chase will hold on to these gains.=20The bank is particularly proud of its standing in two areas: mergers and ac=quisitions, and the underwriting of large investment-grade bond deals.=20The bank ranked 5th worldwide in the highly profitable category of advising= on mergers during the first nine months of 2001, up from Chase s 12th-plac=e finish and J. P. Morgan s 10th-place standing during the same period last= year, according to Thomson Financial Securities data.=20The merger and acquisitions business, which Chase had been slowly building =for years, is stronger following the merger with J. P. Morgan, said Mr. Lee=, a vice chairman at the bank. As a result, the bank is able to win assignm=ents providing advice to customers who dealt with the old Chase only for lo=ans.=20Mr. Lee remains proud of the bank s work with Enron, the energy company, de=spite its troubles. J. P. Morgan Chase, along with Citigroup, raised $1 bil=lion in bank financing for Enron earlier this month. It was also hired to a=dvise the company, which hopes to be saved from collapse by being taken ove=r by Dynegy.=20The old Chase, long a lending powerhouse, would have had a good shot at lea=ding the bank financing, but an advisory role would have been less certain.= Mr. Lee said the investment banker advising Enron came from the old J. P. =Morgan. But with merger activity slow, there are few such deals to go aroun=d.=20The bank is also proud of its strength in long-term investment-grade bonds,= another area that business executives say has been enhanced by the merger.= It moved up to second place in that area so far this year, compared with s=ixth place a year ago.=20The bank has taken advantage of a boom in large corporate bond offerings, a= surge driven by today s low interest rates. In May J. P. Morgan Chase rais=ed $12 billion in bonds for WorldCom, the telecommunications company, in th=e largest corporate debt deal in the United States on record.=20Unfortunately for J. P. Morgan Chase, the fees for underwriting investment-=grade debt are small compared with the money to be earned coordinating offe=rings of stock, where J. P. Morgan Chase remains a second-tier competitor.==20The bank actually lost market share in the rankings for underwriters of sto=ck, falling to 9th place this year, compared with the old J. P. Morgan s 6t=h-place finish a year ago. (Chase was 11th.)=20Mr. Harrison said the bank was taking advantage of the slowdown in stock of=ferings to build momentum slowly in that business.   We think we have a cha=nce in the second half of this year to be in the top five,   he said.=20Given the slowdown, some bankers predict that Mr. Harrison will ultimately =do another deal, either to expand his consumer banking business or to bolst=er weak areas in investment banking, like the equity division.=20  The general view is that the combination with J. P. Morgan didn t do enou=gh,   one investment banker said.=20Mr. Harrison disagrees:   I don t feel,   he said,   we need to do another =large deal to be successful.  Photo: William B. Harrison Jr., the chief executive, says he has no doubts =about the wisdom of forming J. P. Morgan Chase, even though the the economy= has slowed since then.

That wa=s followed by renewed volatility in power prices, and this time the prices =were headed down, not up.=20And then came a crushing blow against trading firms - the unraveling of the= industry s largest player, Enron Corp. (ENE).=20Simply put, the perfect storm stalled, and a business once buoyed by high g=as prices, strong demand and tight supply now lies in tatters.=20The stocks of companies whom some say should be valued more like growth sto=cks than utilities are instead mired at around nine-times earnings - about =where traditional utilities trade.=20And the chance for recovery in 2002?=20Basu Mullick, portfolio manager of the Neuberger Berman Partners fund, is w=illing to bet there is. He thinks energy traders deserve at least the same =price-to-earnings multiple as the broader market s median, which is current=ly between 16- to 17-times future earnings, he said. It s just a matter of =time before the stocks get there.=20""They were just recovering from Gray Davis,"" Mullick said, referring to the= governor of California, who had accused ""out-of-state"" energy traders of a=rtificially inflating the price of power in the state, and triggering the s=tate s energy crisis. ""Now, they are recovering from Enron.""=20The fund manager also blames lower commodity prices, warm weather and poor =demand for the recent weak performance in the group.=20""Energy convergence companies are putting up terrific growth rates,"" he sai=d. ""I don t think they should get the same valuation as a garden-variety ut=ility.""=20Still, others think the stock market is continuing to make distinctions bet=ween the energy traders by taking a harder look at the companies  strategie=s and financial disclosures.=20Enron s precarious financial situation underscores the importance of accoun=ting issues. Although many of Enron s financial problems aren t solely the =fault of mark-to-market accounting issues, there has been growing attention= paid to this form of financial reporting because of the earnings volatilit=y it can create.=20Answers Elude Investors=20Investors are asking hard questions, and not always getting the answers the=y want.=20Using mark-to-market methods, a company calculates the fair market value of= a commodity position - whether it s a contract, an option, a swap, etc. - =at the time, even if the value of the position is realized over a longer pe=riod. The problem with this method is the actual cash a company realizes fr=om the position might not be the same value the company calculated in its o=riginal assessment. Also, sometimes it isn t easy to calculate the fair val=ue of the commodity position. This is particularly true in instances where =the market for the commodity isn t liquid.=20Over time, companies with the highest level of disclosure regarding their m=ark-to-market gains will most likely trade at higher multiples to counterpa=rts that provide little or no disclosure, said ABN AMRO Inc. analyst Paul P=atterson.=20Encouragingly, it appears companies may already be responding to the call f=or added disclosure. According to a survey Patterson conducted, more compan=ies with energy trading units were willing to disclose the details of their= mark-to-market accounting practices during third-quarter conference calls =compared with those in the second quarter.=20Patterson said he prefers earnings that are cash-based.=20""All things being equal, we believe reported earnings that more closely ref=lect the timely realization of cash have a higher quality associated with t=hem than earnings that do not,"" he said.=20He expects investors to become smarter and learn to distinguish between ear=nings growth through accrual accounting and growth fueled by mark-to-market= accounting.=20At the end of the day, it is not a matter of simply producing profits, but =being able to say where those earnings came from, said one investor, who ma=nages a pension fund.=20Some investors also may be placing a greater emphasis on the cash flow the =energy merchants produce.=20Tim O Brien, portfolio manager of the Gabelli Utilities Fund, said energy m=erchants that own the physical power assets to back up their trading positi=ons should trade at a premium to an independent power producers and traditi=onal utility companies. Still, the stocks should be valued at less than the= growth rate of the company because of their heavy exposures to commodity p=rices.=20Energy merchants include companies such as Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Duke Energy C=orp. (DUK) and Dominion Resources Inc. (D).=20According to O Brien, the group never deserved to have the price-to-earning=s multiples above 20- to 30-times earnings, which were once paid for the st=ocks.=20""We all got sucked up by the up-leg of the cycle and forgot just how cyclic=al these companies are,"" O Brien said, adding that the average multiple sho=uld be in the high single-digits to the high-teens.=20As for independent power producers - which are companies without regulated =operations that own power plants to generate electricity to sell and trade =in the wholesale market - the group may wind up being valued on the basis o=f the replacement costs of the assets in their portfolio, according to O Br=ien.=20""One analogy is that they are basically like commercial real-estate plays,""= O Brien said.=20That could mean stocks such as Calpine Corp.

It is also exploring the idea of alliances with oth=er exchanges, and considering developing ""e-mini"" contracts - smaller energ=y contracts for Internet-based trade by retail investors.=20""There s new management in place at the exchange,"" said Nymex spokeswoman N=achamah Jacobovits. ""They re rethinking all of our business strategies, and= one very massive strategy was the idea of this major eNymex B2B (business-=to-business) system launch with a whole new slate of products.""=20Nymex and GlobalView Software Inc., a company that initially worked on buil=ding the eNymex trading system, have sued each other in a dispute over work= on the project.=20Kiodex, an electronic-trading technology firm that has developed the back e=nd of the eNymex system, took on added development work for the project aft=er GlobalView departed. The trade engine Kiodex was asked to build is ""subs=tantially complete, but the company can t speak to Nymex s overall electron=ic-trading strategy,"" a Kiodex source said.=20The eNymex platform was conceived as a forum for trading over-the-counter e=nergy products, but Nymex has already moved ahead with plans for trading so=me of them on Access, initially an overnight trading system that was expand=ed in September. It hopes, for example, to launch gas swaps based on delive=ry at the Henry Hub within the next six weeks on Access, Jacobovits said.==20""We ve expedited plans for a Henry Hub natural gas swap contract,"" Jacobovi=ts said. ""Traders could be looking for OTC clearing on a neutral-based plat=form, which is a factor in that decision.""=20Before Sept. 14, Access was used only to trade energy futures at night, aft=er the day s Nymex session had ended. Use was limited to Nymex members with= dedicated phone systems.=20The exchange had been planning to expand use of Access, but ended up doing =so sooner than it had expected. On Sept. 14, it started offering Access tra=ding over the Internet, a move that will eventually allow Nymex to open up =trade to more users.=20The move was intended to help keep futures markets liquid after the Sept. 1=1 attack on the World Trade Center. Nymex s building, located near where th=e trade towers stood, was shut down for several days after the attacks. Exp=anding its already existent Access system to the Internet helped ease poten=tial liquidity problems that could have arisen from shortened floor trading= hours after Nymex reopened.=20Development of the eNymex system began last year under the direction of for=mer Nymex Chairman Daniel Rappaport. In August, Nymex said it would launch =the eNymex platform within four to eight months. New Nymex President J. Rob=ert ""Bo"" Collins Jr. said then that vendor problems had slowed development =of the system s front-end technology and caused the delays. But he still ex=pected eNymex to launch without any meaningful changes to its original prod=uct line.=20If Nymex combines parts or all of the platform originally intended as eNyme=x with Access, the new system may end up being known as eNymex.=20""eNymex right now is looking for a new mission,"" said an industry source cl=ose to Nymex. ""You know how politics works. We don t scrap it, we just rena=me it. Anything we do electronically is now going to be called eNymex. But =the original deal and concept that Rappaport initiated is done.""=20Nymex s reconsideration comes as the energy-trading world undergoes rapid c=hange. The two most successful online energy trading platforms -- Enron Cor=p. s (ENE) EnronOnline, and IntercontinentalExchange, or ICE -- have seen t=heir luck turn - in opposite directions.=20Enron Corp. (ENE), which accounts for about 25% of the trade in U.S. power =and gas markets, faces questions about its creditworthiness as the Securiti=es and Exchange Commission investigates complicated financial dealings. Enr=on s possible merger with Dynegy Inc. (DYN), now appears to be in doubt, an=d energy trading companies are pulling back their exposure to the company.==20Enron executes about 60% of its power and gas trades on EnronOnline. When E=nron s troubles surfaced last month, Nymex quickly moved to extend its clea=ring services to over-the-counter natural gas derivatives, a move the tradi=ng community saw as an attempt to grab market share.=20ICE, on the other hand, is moving ahead with plans to capture more energy t=rade on its electronic format. ICE closed a deal this summer to acquire the= London-based International Petroleum Exchange - Nymex s chief competitor a=nd Europe s largest traditional energy exchange. It plans to move all IPE e=nergy contracts to its Internet-based system and offer clearing services fo=r some over-the-counter contracts.=20Nymex is exploring alliances that could give it a better footing in the new= competitive landscape. One idea under review is a joint venture with the C=hicago Mercantile Exchange to offer e-mini contracts for Nymex products on =CME s Globex electronic-trading system, the person close to Nymex said.=20Nymex officials wouldn t confirm whether they re talking with the CME, but =they said the relationship between the exchanges is a warm one.=20""Nymex is always open to strategic alliances,"" Jacobovits said. ""There s no=thing we ve agreed to at this point, but we have open dialogue with a numbe=r of exchanges concerning strategic alliances. We have a good relationship =with the Chicago Merc, and we certainly would be open to working with them.=""=20Shortly after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in New York shut down the Nyme=x trading floor, the CME said it would be willing to offer Nymex products o=n its Globex system until Nymex resumed operations, Jacobovits said.=20-By Stephen Parker, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-4426; stephen.parker@dowjo=nes.comCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Last week a couple of heavy hitters left money on= the table.=20Mark McGwire, the home-run-hitting baseball player for St. Louis, retired. =And he let it be known that he never signed a two-year, $30 million contrac=t his agent negotiated last spring. Why? Because he wanted to find out if h=is injured right knee would allow him to play as well as he had before. It =didn t, and he decided he wasn t worth that kind of money.Then Ken Lay, chairman of Enron Corp., said he won t take the $60.6 million= he had coming to him in a severance agreement that comes into play when En=ron is sold to Dynegy Corp.=20Of course, neither McGwire nor Lay will ever have to consider my fallback r=etirement plan - sacking groceries at the supermarket, carrying them to the= car and hoping for a big tip. Still, it was a class act on both their part=s. McGwire only hit .187 last season, well below his lifetime average. And =Lay? Well, let s say that rarely in the history of American capitalism has =a company sunk as fast as Enron.=20Remember that earlier this year its stock hit a top of $82 a share. Now it =s hovering in the single-digit level, and Enron is being forced to sell its=elf to a smaller rival.=20The stock price incentive=20How did Enron get into this position? Put the blame on the company s relent=less drive to push up its stock price. And a big reason for that push comes= from the way American companies compensate top executives.=20In the last couple of decades, executive compensation has soared. The avera=ge chief executive officer today makes 531 times as much in salary, bonuses= and stock options as the average factory worker.=20Apologists for executive pay say these kinds of figures really aren t relev=ant. Most of the money top executives receive doesn t come from base pay or= bonuses but from stock options.=20Such options usually work this way. Executives are given hundreds or thousa=nds of shares of stock that they can only buy from the company at a future =date. The sales price can be anything from 10 cents to the price of the sto=ck on the date the options were granted. If the stock increases past the ex=ercise price in the option, the executive can buy the stock and then sell i=t, making big bucks. It the stock has dropped below the option price - it s= underwater, in the jargon - then those options are worthless.=20Granting options aligns the interests of the top executives with the shareh=olders, those who favor this sort of incentive say. And that s true, if you= talking about in-and-out traders. But it s not true if we re looking out f=or the interests of the majority who hold stocks for the long term.=20Keeping the debt hidden=20Keeping its stock price soaring was what brought down Enron.=20To hype the stock, Enron s execs were hiding the debt it took on to fuel it=s amazing growth and some of its dicier investments, in partnerships. Enron= was supposedly only a minority partner in these deals. That way it could m=ove a large portion of its debt off its books in that partnership. That, in= turn, made the company s earnings look better.=20When Enron s executives finally fessed up, they had to write down their pro=fits over the past few years by 20 percent. But the real irony here is that= 80 percent is still a heck of a lot of money. But by that time, the majori=ty of shareholders simply had no faith in Enron s bookkeeping.=20Now look at Lay s compensation. In 1999 he exercised stock options and made= $44 million on them. In 2000, sales of options brought him $123 million, a=nd this year about $26 million, according to a study published by Bloomberg= News.=20Was Lay deliberating deceiving investors to keep his stock options profitab=le? I don t think so. He was simply following the latest fad in corporate g=overnance. He was aligning himself with the interests of the shareholders.==20The shareholders were happy with that high stock price. Nobody - besides so=me stock analysts - complained about Enron s often- impenetrable bookkeepin=g until that stock price started to fall.=20Would Enron s bookkeeping have been different if top executives received fe=wer stock options? Maybe.=20Fewer stock options would mean lower pay for the top guys. And no one would= want that job if he were only going to make $10 million a year instead of =$100 million.=20Just kidding.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

ROSEN11/18/2001The New York TimesPage 8, Column 2c. 2001 New York Times CompanyDESPITE last week s plunge in the price of crude oil and in shares of big o=il companies, some Wall Street analysts remain upbeat about the long-term p=rospects for energy stocks.=20  These very dramatic downturns are great buying opportunities,   said Tina= Vital, an oil and gas analyst at Standard & Poor s, who recommends a broad= group of integrated oil companies, including Exxon Mobil, ChevronTexaco, R=oyal Dutch/Shell, BP and TotalFinaElf.   They have excellent management, a =top dividend yield and are a safe haven for investors,   she said, provided= that investors are patient and can bear short-term swings.Last week s price declines were set off by Russian oil companies  refusal t=o accept demands by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries f=or big production cuts. They were a reminder that the sector is extremely v=olatile.   Oil could go to $10 a barrel short term,   she said, but there i=s no certainty of that. The oil producers could reach an agreement by Janua=ry, sending prices upward. Over the long term, she expects to see productio=n cuts.=20Demand for energy has grown only 0.5 percent this year, and prices have bee=n declining for some time for both crude oil and gasoline -- as drivers hav=e seen at the gas pump. West Texas intermediate crude closed Friday at $18.=03 on the New York Mercantile Exchange, up 58 cents from its Thursday close=, the lowest since June 1999. But an economic recovery, expected by late 20=02, could cause demand to pick up, analysts say.=20As oil prices have dropped, so have the prices of most oil stocks, but not =as much as the overall market since the beginning of 2000. Over that period=, the S.& P. energy index has lost 8 percent, while the S.& P. 500-stock in=dex is down 23 percent.=20A report issued last week by the Energy Department said that while the Sept=. 11 terrorist attacks had intensified the country s economic slowdown,   t=hey are not expected to result in any long-term volatility in energy market=s.   The report estimated that commercial energy demand would rise 1.7 perc=ent a year through 2020, instead of the 1.2 percent predicted only a year a=go. Its predictions assume increased use of computers and office equipment,= and slower increases in fuel efficiency for cars and trucks.=20WHILE they warn of the possibility of wild price shifts in the months ahead=, other analysts are similarly bullish for the long term. L. Bruce Lanni, s=enior oil analyst at A. G. Edwards & Sons in New York, said that any potent=ial price war was likely to be fairly short-lived, because neither OPEC nor= non-OPEC countries could   withstand low oil prices for a prolonged period= of time,   and prices should rebound sharply as a result,   back up in the= lower to mid-$20 range.  =20Low prices could be painful for most of the oil companies in the short term=, but Mr. Lanni, too, sees value in the stocks.=20His top pick is Conoco, now trading at $24.30; his 12-month target is $34. =  We remain confident,   he said,   that the company s annual oil and gas p=roduction should grow by about 4 percent, on average, over the next several= years.  =20Conoco s debt, at 55 percent of capital, is relatively high, but he expects= the company s strong cash flow -- it equaled $5.33 a share last year -- to= reduce the debt level to 46 percent next year and to 38 percent in 2003. T=he company s after-tax interest cost is only 3.5 percent, he said.=20Mr. Lanni also favors Kerr-McGee, a natural gas exploration and production =company, and BP, calling both undervalued. He regards Exxon Mobil, Royal Du=tch/Shell and ChevronTexaco as fully priced, so he is not recommending buyi=ng them now.   If you own them, hold them,   he said.=20William Featherston, executive director and an oil and gas exploration anal=yst at UBS Warburg, said he felt   near-term caution but medium-term optimi=sm for sustainably higher   natural gas prices. He said he would encourage =investors to consider buying shares of exploration and production companies= over the next two months. His top picks are Apache, Kerr-McGee and EOG Res=ources.=20Such stocks are highly volatile, he said. They are   trading-oriented vehic=les, and short-term volatility in commodity prices generally provides the m=ost attractive entry and exit points,   he said.   While natural gas prices= declined throughout most of this year, prices rose at a startling pace, fr=om $1.75 per million cubic feet at the end of September to over $3 per mill=ion cubic feet within weeks.  =20He cited three reasons for the price rally: a decline in gas surpluses, pre=dictions of a colder-than-normal winter and what he has called   pathetic t=hird-quarter natural gas production,   despite record drilling activity.=20The tangled finances of the Enron Corporation were also a factor in the rec=ent price increase for natural gas futures, he said. Enron, which marketed =25 billion cubic feet a day of natural gas, or more than 40 percent of the =nation s demand, is under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Comm=ission and announced a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity from de=als with partnerships involving its former chief financial officer. It also= reported a third-quarter loss and restated earlier earnings. Enron has agr=eed to be taken over by Dynegy, a smaller rival, for about $9 billion in st=ock. Dynegy is also assuming about $13 billion in debt.=20Anxiety over whether the Enron investigation would disrupt deliveries or ha=ve other market repercussions led to an increase in prices. While it is   d=ifficult to quantify the Enron factor,   Mr. Featherston said, the short-te=rm effects on natural gas prices seem to be over.=20OTHER factors, of course, could also mean a bumpy ride for energy investors= over the next several months. The status of the war against terrorism, Pre=sident Bush s decision to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, thus helpin=g OPEC in reducing excess global capacity, and a United Nations review of t=he food-for-oil deal with Iraq expected in December could each have a signi=ficant impact on battered oil prices.=20Nevertheless, Ms. Vital said, for the long term, energy will probably be in= short supply, and new sources must be developed. So she also likes the pro=spects of two drilling companies, Noble Drilling and Nabors Industries. Bot=h took a beating last week, along with the oil companies, so again she sees= buying opportunities.=20Bern Fleming, portfolio manager of the AXP Utilities Income fund in Minneap=olis, who has stakes in Dynegy, Duke Energy and Dominion Resources, said al=l three had good prospects for growth, thanks to a mix of assets,   managem=ent I respect and solid business plans.

Aquila said it began making contingency plans in case Dynegywithdrew from its $24 billion takeover of Enron, the paperreported.     Enron, the largest energy trader, decided to sell after itsshares plunged this year and a federal investigation of accountingirregularities limited its ability to finance operations. Enron scollapse would have caused upheaval in energy markets, where thecompany does one-quarter of all gas and power trades.     Dynegy s agreement to buy Enron allows it to withdraw fromthe transaction under certain circumstances, the FT said.PERSPECTIVESA tale of greed and hubrisWaldo Proffitt11/18/2001Sarasota Herald-TribuneAllF2(Copyright 2001)For anyone not already disenchanted with the idea of total deregulation of =public utilities, the most recent installment of the miserable Enron story =as it unfolded last week should serve as a convincing example of the folly =of relying on unregulated profit- driven enterprises to supply our energy.==20A year ago Enron was the darling of Wall Street, the poster boy for the uti=lity industry, its stock selling for about $85 a share. Last week its stock= was worth about 10 percent of that and the company had agreed to be bought= by a competitor. There was fear the company s bond rating might fall to th=e ""junk"" level.What happened? It will take months, if not years, to untangle the details, =but it is clear that the main culprit was greed, closely followed by hubris=.=20Not too many years ago Enron was a small, struggling, gas pipeline company =in Houston. As deregulation spread to more and more states, Enron began acq=uiring pipelines, gas producers and utilities.=20It also acquired friends in high places, especially the Bush family and the=ir key political advisers. And, it discovered it could make money faster by= selling and trading energy than by producing it. Enron sold many of its ge=nerating plants and became the biggest ""power broker"" in the nation.=20Though it was by no means the largest winner in the con game that bilked Ca=lifornia consumers of tens of billions of dollars, Enron was one of the fir=st power barons to take advantage of California s flawed deregulation law -=- virtually written by in-state and out-of- state utility companies.=20The California fiasco soured (probably) most Americans on utility deregulat=ion, but Enron was not singled out for calumny, and management saw no reaso=n to examine its business ethics.=20Contrarywise. management had visions of even greater profits, which it felt= no obligation to share with ordinary stockholders. The chief financial off=icer and other high-ranking executives set up affiliated or subsidiary part=nerships which made deals with Enron. I do not understand the details of th=ese arrangements, but neither do independent accountants, the Securities an=d Exchange Commission or congressional investigators. It does seem clear th=at the Enron insiders made millions for themselves.=20Enron acknowledges, without explaining, that stockholder equity dropped $1.=2 billion in the last quarter and that it had for the last five years overs=tated profits by some $600 million. Whether this was by design or by mistak=e is in dispute, but it is the sort of thing which tends to undermine the c=onfidence of investors.=20So much for greed. Back to hubris. It seems not unlikely that Enron s leade=rs felt they might not be punished for a modest amount of corner-cutting be=cause they had friends in high places.=20The chief executive, Kenneth L. Lay, was and is a personal friend of George= W. Bush and has easy access to the White House. For many months after the =new administration took office, Karl Rove, Bush s top political strategist,= owned Enron stock valued at $100,000 to $250,000, and sold it only after h=e had been able to secure a ruling that he did not have to pay capital gain=s tax immediately because he sold to avoid a conflict of interest. Lawrence= Lindsey, the president s chief economic coordinator, and I. Lewis Libby, V=ice President Cheney s chief of staff, owned stock in Enron, and Lindsey wa=s paid $50,000 last year as a consultant for Enron.=20Enron and its employees gave more than anyone else to Bush s four political= campaigns -- one (unsuccessful) for Congress, two for governor and one for= president. In 2000, Enron and its employees gave $113,000 to Bush s campai=gn, $250,000 to the Republican National Committee, and $300,000 to the Pres=idential Inauguration Committee.=20Cabinet appointments affecting energy policy, key sub-Cabinet appointments,= administration action or inaction in the California energy mess, and the o=verall energy policy of the administration could hardly have been more favo=rable to the interests of Enron.=20And now a couple of questions: Is it possible the unusual financial maneuve=rs by Enron went unnoticed or even unsuspected by all the savvy Texas oilme=n in the Bush administration? Were those of them with heavy investments in =Enron unconcerned about the conduct of the company? Was Enron right in thin=king its friends in government would not be in a hurry to investigate or to= reprimand?=20Or, in light of our preoccupation with terrorism, will the Enron case get m=uch attention from the federal government? Or from voters?=20Waldo Proffitt is the former editor of the Herald-Tribune.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

If =you re having trouble this Thanksgiving week finding reasons to be thankful= about anything investment-related, try these on for size:=20* ""Asset allocation"" is no longer just a quaint theory. The paramount inves=ting rule has always been to spread your money around to reduce risk. But i=t took the worst stock bear market in 25 years to bring this lesson home fo=r many people who thought equities only rose in value.=20Now, millions of investors have a far better appreciation for just how much= they can lose in stocks--and how bonds and short-term cash savings can off=set market losses and preserve capital.=20It has been a hard lesson, to be sure. But investors who take asset allocat=ion to heart will be laying a much more solid foundation for their money in= the long run. And don t underestimate what that can mean for your peace of= mind long term.=20* The wisdom of saving money on a regular basis has been relearned. In the =late 1990s, many economists lamented how the U.S. savings rate continued to= shrink. Some people felt there was little need to put significant new sums= into savings when the stocks or stock mutual funds they owned seemed to be= rising nonstop.=20In other words, many Americans were letting the stock market do their savin=g for them when share prices were rising 20% or more each year.=20Now, with shares down and with the likelihood of much more moderate returns= on stocks in this decade, it s clear that many people will have to find a =way to save regularly if they re going to meet their long-term financial go=als, especially retirement.=20This may not be a pleasant reality, but it s better for most people to have= faced this fact sooner rather than later, while there may be time to make =up lost ground.=20* A healthy skepticism has replaced mindless euphoria about stocks and thos=e who tout them. The market s slide has discredited a legion of Wall Street= analysts, money managers and others whose knowledge, understanding and jud=gment were clearly lacking, in retrospect.=20Investors have come to see that having blind faith in those who present the=mselves as ""experts"" is a highly dangerous strategy, if it can be called a =strategy at all.=20Sure, it may have been more fun when technology stocks were shooting the mo=on and nobody had much use for reviewing a company s fundamentals. But that= wasn t investing--it was speculating, and on a massive, and ultimately rui=nous, scale.=20People have learned to be less trusting about what others say about the mar=ket, and that is more likely to be beneficial than detrimental to their por=tfolios in the long run.=20Just ask anyone who shifted their entire 401(k) retirement savings sum into= aggressive-growth mutual funds in the first quarter of 2000--right before =the market peaked--because of the bullish comments of some 25-year-old tech= stock analyst. Those investors aren t likely to make a move like that agai=n.=20* Free-market forces are weeding out the weak players and the phonies.

It probably would have been much= worse for all concerned if those companies had sucked up investors  funds =for another year instead of failing when they did.=20But the market isn t just eliminating small companies that never had much o=f a future.

GlassmanDon t Be A Pudd n head, DiversifyJames K. Glassman11/18/2001The Washington PostFINALH01Copyright 2001, The Washington Post Co. All Rights ReservedWarren Buffett, who was probably the greatest investor of the 20th century,= is fond of quoting the salacious actress Mae West as saying, ""Too much of =a good thing can be wonderful."" In the market, such a motto would lead you =to avoid diversification and instead concentrate your portfolio in stocks y=ou really, really like.=20Peter Lynch, who was probably the best mutual fund manager of the 20th cent=ury, calls spreading yourself too thin ""diworseification.""Smart, witty and brilliant at picking stocks, Buffett and Lynch may not nee=d diversification, but the rest of us do. When you own one stock, you re ou=t on a limb. For example, very few analysts -- with or without a conflict o=f interest -- predicted that shares of Enron, the energy and trading compan=y, would tumble by 90 percent in a year. Put all your eggs in a basket like= that and you end up with a gooey mess. The more stocks you own -- as long =as they are in different industries -- the more the overall riskiness of yo=ur portfolio is modulated.=20The reason you don t want a super-risky portfolio is simple: While Warren B=uffett may be calm and prescient enough to ride out severe dips in the valu=e of his holdings, most investors are not. A portfolio that increases in pr=ice by 10 percent each and every year is worth exactly the same at the end =of three years as a portfolio that falls by half the first year, rises by t=hree-quarters the second and rises by 52 percent the third. But reasonable =investors prefer the consistent ride. It prevents them from doing something= stupid, such as selling all their stocks after losing half their money dur=ing that first disastrous year.=20Consider the sad case of James D. McCall, who earlier this month resigned a=s manager of the Merrill Lynch Focus Twenty mutual fund. Two years ago, Mer=rill wanted McCall s services so desperately that the firm went to court to= pry McCall away from his previous employer, Pilgrim Baxter, where he rang =up impressive gains in the late 1990s. (His big success was called PBHG Lar=ge Cap 20.) And when they got McCall, Merrill s brokers raised more than $1=.5 billion from their clients for him to invest. While the average growth-s=tock mutual fund owns about 100 stocks, with the top 10 holdings representi=ng about one-fourth of the portfolio s total value, McCall specialized in w=hat are called ""concentrated portfolios."" In the case of Merrill Lynch Focu=s Twenty, he owned, as the name implies, just 20 stocks. At last report, hi=s top 10 holdings accounted for a whopping two-thirds of the fund s assets.==20If McCall had spread his 20 stocks among, say, a dozen different industries=, he might have smoothed his ride. Instead, 69 percent of his assets went t=o technology firms. The Focus fund and a smaller one that McCall ran called= Premier Growth were launched in March 2000. Within just 17 months, all but= $650 million of the clients  original $1.5 billion had vanished.=20It is hard to imagine losing as much as Focus Twenty did even if you tried.= As of Nov. 9, the week McCall resigned, the fund was down 72 percent for t=he year, compared with a loss of 14 percent for the Standard & Poor s 500-s=tock index, the benchmark for fund managers. According to the latest report= from Morningstar Mutual Funds, 19 of McCall s 20 stocks had declined durin=g 2001, the only exception being Harley-Davidson. More amazing, 16 of the 1=9 losers had fallen by at least half. (By the way, Enron was McCall s seven=th-largest holding.)=20""This fund has had a wretched existence,"" wrote Morningstar analyst Kunal K=apoor, who did admit a grudging admiration for McCall s perseverance. McCal=l s ""faith may turn out to be well placed over time,"" Kapoor said. Unfortun=ately, time ran out.=20My point here is not to pick on McCall but to reveal the perils of concentr=ation. Buying Focus Twenty as a technology fund, and consigning it to no mo=re than one-fifth of your holdings (with the rest of your assets in diversi=fied, conventional stocks or funds) might have made sense, but Focus Twenty= was touted as a ""long-term capital appreciation"" fund, not a sector fund. =Here, it failed, but maybe it didn t have to.=20The manager who made the concentrated fund popular, Tom Marsico, who ran Ja=nus Twenty, took care to spread his holdings around. His successor, Scott S=choelzel, has suffered losses lately (he is down 28 percent year-to-date, b=ut that s after a total gain of 546 percent in the preceding five years), b=ut they have not been nearly so catastrophic -- and for good reason. Schoel=zel s last report lists among his top 10 holdings three tech stocks, two fi=nancials, one drug company, one energy firm (whoops, Enron again), one indu=strial, one consumer-durables company and one services firm.=20For investors in individual stocks, the important question is this: How muc=h diversification is enough? Some risk is inherent in even the broadest por=tfolio. This is called market, or ""systematic,"" risk. Over the past 75 year=s, market risk, as measured in standard deviation, has been about 20 percen=t. In other words, in two-thirds of the years the annual return of the S&P =has fallen into a band ranging from 20 points lower to 20 points higher tha=n its average return of 11 percent; that is, between a loss of 9 percent an=d a gain of 31 percent. That s still volatile, but if you invest in stocks =you have to live with it.=20What you don t have to live with is anything more volatile. So your objecti=ve in building a portfolio is to try to approximate systematic risk and avo=id what is called ""idiosyncratic,"" or extra, risk. A portfolio with just a =few stocks, or one like McCall s, that is overloaded in a single sector, ha=s lots of idiosyncratic risk. In 1977, an influential study found that inve=stors could nearly eliminate that extra risk by owning just 20 stocks in a =wide variety of sectors; in fact, owning eight or 10 stocks depressed risk =sharply.=20Recently, however, the market has appeared to be far more volatile, and a n=ew study by a group of economists headed by John Campbell of Harvard found =that many more stocks were needed -- around 50 -- to bring a portfolio down= to the same level of riskiness as the broad market. What Campbell s group =found was that neither the market itself nor individual sectors had become =more volatile in the 1990s, but that stocks within those sectors had, so yo=u need to own more of them.=20But owning 50 stocks is a pain in the neck -- and it brings up the Buffett-=Lynch admonitions about too much diversification. It is hard just to take t=he time to make the selections, but even buy-and-hold investors need to kee=p track of the companies they own to spot adverse changes in management, pr=oduct failures or new competition (not to mention Enron-style accounting sh=enanigans) -- signs that it s time to sell.=20One good answer is to achieve balance by owning a combination of mutual fun=ds and stocks. For example, you might want to put 50 percent of the money y=ou have allotted for stocks into a fund that mimics the S&P itself, like Va=nguard Index 500, which charges rock-bottom expenses and guarantees that ri=sk won t exceed systematic levels. You could also consider a broad fund tha=t s managed by human beings, such as Meridian Value or Baron Growth, which =are recommended by Sheldon Jacobs, editor of the No-Load Fund Investor news=letter. Then another 25 percent of your holdings can go into a few sector f=unds that specialize in technology, real estate, energy and small-caps, and= the final 25 percent into a portfolio of 10 to 20 individual stocks. (I ow=n 16, at last count.)=20There are many valid variations. Just don t emulate Mark Twain.=20In a letter to clients recently, Anthony M. Maramarco of David L.

But don t bank on it.When corporate insiders can sell the company and stroll away with millions =while workers and other stockholders are left with peanuts, it would be har=d not to be bitter.=20As Oregonian business writer Jeff Manning reported Friday, local employees =of Portland General Electric, an Enron subsidiary, watched their retirement= savings sink after Enron announced on Oct. 16 that it would lose $618 mill=ion in the fourth quarter. This came after Enron officers made more than $1=36 million selling stocks earlier in the year.=20Then on Nov. 8, Enron dropped the other shoe: It admitted it had overstated= earnings for four years by $586 million, or 20 percent. Over those few wee=ks, Enron shares plunged from $33.84 to its $9 close on Friday.=20The four-year overstatement developed through some novel accounting methods=. Enron and its auditor, Arthur Anderson, insist that its financial reports= were all within proper standards, but the mechanics in this case included =obscuring debt by placing it on the ledgers of other entities so that the p=arent company s profit picture appeared rosier than it actually was.=20The weeks from mid-October to early November were wrenching for employees. =Because the company was changing its fund manager, they were powerless to m=ake any changes in their 401(k) plans. PGE chief executive Peggy Fowler poi=nts out that the change in 401(k) plan managers was announced last summer. =And although employees could have gotten out of Enron stocks over the histo=ry of the plan, Enron seemed to be an attractive investment.=20Company executives, though, were selling. Jeffrey Skilling, who was promote=d to Enron chief executive early in the year but resigned in August, sold m=ore than $5 million in company shares according to transaction records cove=ring the first half of the year.=20Former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, who was fired last month in =an action related to the financial mess, made $14 million in stock sales be=tweeen March and November of last year.

All Rights ReservedFINANCE WEEK - From dealing to reeling - The legacy of the late 1990s stock= market bubble remains with us, as does irrationality THE LONG VIEW - BARRY= RILEY.=20Optimism is back. Stock markets around the globe have typically rallied by =20 per cent since rock bottom was reached on September 21. Only 9 per cent =of global fund managers believe equities will be lower in 12 months, accord=ing to a Merrill Lynch survey published this week.But the legacy of the late 1990s stock market bubble remains with us. The c=hallenge is how to minimise the level of irrationality. Two of the UK s big=gest losers from crazy prices reported on Tuesday. Vodafone suffered #11.45=bn of write-downs - but curiously, made no provisions against the sky-high =#13.1bn it paid for third-generation mobile phone licences in 2000.=20Such payments, argued Sir Christopher Gent, Voda-fone s chief executive, we=re merely what the market demanded at the time. It is interesting to note, =too, that Paul Klemperer, the Oxford professor who is an expert in ""auction= theory"" and advised the British government, has defended the disastrous ou=tcome by arguing that the prices reflected the capital market s view of 3G =s prospects. The common theme here is that it is nobody s fault if crazy pr=ices are paid, because they are legitimised by the stock market.=20Marconi, which is financially in a much worse state than the mobile phone g=iant, has written off most of the #4.1bn paid for US internet hardware comp=anies in 1999. There has also been a great deal of controversy in the US du=ring the past few weeks over the near-collapse of Enron, the power group be=ing rescued by a takeover bid from its smaller rival Dynegy. There was an o=bvious failure by investors - and by stock market analysts - to assess the =true risks at Enron.=20Smart businessmen will sellat mad prices, but why on earth should they buy?= The trouble is, too many academics have developed theories of value based =on rational expectations. The real world is unfortunately very different.==20Some of the distortions had obvious technical origins. The Vodafone bubble =of 1999 reflected the cross-border takeover of Mannesmann and the artificia=l weighting shortages that developed from that transaction as Vodafone ball=ooned in market capitalisation to reach, at one stage, 16 per cent of the F=TSE 100 Index. The market price was driven not by normal corporate fundamen=tals, but by the desire of most fund managers to reach a market weighting, =at which point they were ""safe"" in terms of risk against the index benchmar=k.=20That was the period when investment banks exploited the idea of low free-fl=oat new issues: internet companies, especially, were floated off with only =15 per cent of the stock made available, although anything up to 100 per ce=nt went into the indices, creating serious shortages and bubble valuations.= Changes now being made to the main stock market indices have reduced the p=roblem, but there remains a basic irrationality in the concept that investm=ent risk resides in an index rather than in the underlying stocks.=20Takeovers have always been plagued by irrationality, and indeed this is an =area where academics recognise the problem; over many years they have point=ed out that all the benefits of deals, and often more than all, accrue to t=he shareholders of the companies taken over, while investors in the bidding= companies suffer dilution. Investors know this, and in normal market condi=tions news of a takeover will depress the bidder s share price. But in a bu=bble market these prudent attitudes can be overwhelmed by euphoria, as well= as technical factors relating to demand by fund managers so that they can =maintain their weightings when a bidder is spraying around large quantities= of new equity.=20Also, it is irrational that many more deals are done when the stock market =is high than when it is low. Two years ago, companies such as Marconi were =engaged in buying sprees at daft prices. Now, when prices are much lower, h=ardly any acquisitions are being made (and investment banks are dismissing =thousands of employees). An exception to the deal famine is gold mining, wh=ich just happens to have been one of the stock market s strongest sectors t=his year.=20Another important source of irrationality has been the domination of stock =market analysis by the stockbroking offshoots of the investment banks. Over= recent years their earnings-per-share forecasts for the next calendar year= have been on average 8 per cent too high. This has not just been a mistake=; they have been paid to be over-optimistic. Admittedly, attempts are being= made to restructure the incentives here, as the embarrassed investment ban=ks come under pressure from the regulators and the courts for their errors =of judgment during the bull market, but it remains to be seen whether much =will really change.=20The mystery is why anybody would take notice of these forecasts, and indeed= many professional investors do not. That Merrill survey, incidentally, sho=ws that fund managers on average expect no more than 4 per cent earnings pe=r share growth over the next year, while the stockbrokers  analysts are sti=ll clinging to the hope that it will be 15 per cent.=20A final source of distortion is the tendency of companies to offer their ex=ecutives the wrong sort of incentives. The ruin of Marconi may appear irrat=ional, when multi-billion-pound acquisitions are being declared worthless a=fter only two years. But executives with lucrative stock option plans, whic=h pay off if their gambles go right, combined with golden goodbye and pensi=on packages that are triggered if things go wrong, may well consider it per=fectly rational, from their viewpoint, to take much bigger risks than other= shareholders, or employees, would consider acceptable.=20Moreover, Sir Christopher Gent, shareholders of Vodafone will remember, rec=eived a controversial #10m personal bonus last year for clinching the Manne=smann takeover, a deal that requires #10bn of write-offs.=20In normal market conditions the valuation of equities may be tolerably rati=onal, but in a bubble market the rules are thrown out of the window. Many i=nvestors certainly like the idea of getting rich quickly. That is why many =people subscribe so keenly to national lotteries in which the chance of win=ning is so small as to be not worth rational consideration.=20barry.riley@ft.com.=20(c) Copyright Financial Times Ltd.

Enron, which has been criticized for failing to clearlyexplain how it makes money, may disclose in Monday s filing moreon how much is owed by the company and affiliated partnerships, aswell as any planned job cuts and other cost-saving moves relatedto Dynegy s $24 billion buyout.     ``Investors will be looking for anything that affects thelikelihood of the (Dynegy) deal going through and the timing ofsuch a deal,   said Edward Paik, who helps manage the LibertyUtilities Fund, which owns 1.6 million in Enron shares.     Enron agreed to sell after its stock plunged 67 percent inthree weeks amid an SEC investigation into partnerships run byEnron executives. Investors worry that new disclosures, such aspreviously unreported debt, might threaten Enron s credit ratingand scuttle the merger, possibly pushing Enron into bankruptcy.     ``There s been so much skepticism about what Enron sliabilities are with these partnerships, I m looking to quantifythis,   said Glen Hilton, a fund manager at Montgomery AssetManagement LP, which holds Dynegy shares.     Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay admitted last week that failedinvestments and a loss of investor confidence forced the sale toDynegy, and he and other executives pledged to be more open withinvestors. Lay, 59, said last week he won t accept a severancepackage of more than $60 million that he could have collectedfollowing the takeover.     Enron shares fell 48 cents yesterday to $9. Dynegy fell$1.53, or 3.5 percent, to $42.47.                           Balance Sheet     Enron s third-quarter report, which had been expected lastweek, was delayed by the Dynegy talks and a restatement ofearnings, Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey McMahon said. Enronreduced net income for four years by a combined $586 million toinclude losses from affiliated partnerships.     Monday s filing, called a 10-Q, will include a balance sheetsummarizing assets and debts. Enron for years has omitted balancesheets, which the SEC requires as part of the 10-Q, from its pressreleases announcing earnings.     Investors renewed their criticisms of the practice after Laymentioned during a conference call last month that dealings withtwo partnerships had reduced Enron s shareholder equity, or itsassets minus liabilities, by $1.2 billion. The disclosure led tothe ouster of Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow.     ``Everyone is trying to make their own assessment of what(Enron s) ultimate liability will need to be,   said CommerzbankSecurities analyst Andre Meade, who rates the shares ``hold   anddoesn t own them.     Monday s report probably won t give a complete answer, saidLouis Gagliardi, an analyst at John S. Herold Inc. While thebalance sheet will list liabilities for the partnerships, whichwere set up to buy Enron assets and get debt off the company sbooks, it won t spell out Enron s share, he said.     ``What is the net liability off the balance sheet?  Gagliardi said. ``We really don t know what that number is.                             Credit Rating     Dynegy has said it can back out of the acquisition if Enron slegal liabilities exceed $3.5 billion. The balance sheet ``willhelp us see how good a deal this is for Dynegy,   said KathleenVuchetich, co-manager of the $1.4 billion Strong AmericanUtilities Fund, which owns 284,000 Dynegy shares.     Both companies are based in Houston.     The filing also might offer details on the SEC probe. ``Itmay say what the SEC is looking for, and what the rating agencieshave told them,   said Christopher Ellinghaus, an analyst atWilliams Capital Group. He added, though, ``I don t expect much.       Enron s stock drop led Moody s Investors Service to cut thecompany s debt rating to the lowest investment grade. Dynegy heldoff on a purchase agreement out of concern that the rating wouldbe cut to junk, jeopardizing Enron s ability to raise cash neededto settle its daily power and natural-gas trades.     Enron may reveal where it expects to cut jobs and how much itwill pay to departing employees, Paik said. Chief OperatingOfficer Greg Whalley said last week that fourth-quarter profitwill be hurt by severance payments and reorganization costs. Hedidn t give details.

80677,2001-12-19 07:55:49,"Stephanie, Transwestern has been in discussions with ENA since very early December regarding the sale of the Enron Compression Services gas. The ECS off take is supposed to be 11,000 per day. The fact that ECS was not able to nominate their gas has been problematic for Transwestern in that it causes our line pack to be higher than it otherwise would be. When we began discussions, we were open to the idea of getting the full volume out of our system by the end of the month. If a nomination could have been made that resulted in a sale starting at the beginning of this week, ECS could have sold the entire 363,000 in December. At some point, it becomes unrealistic to expect to be able to do that. It has taken ECS so long to arrange for an agent that a now we are looking at selling the entire volume in just 12 days (~30,000/day). I was expecting the following two things from ENA, 1) confirmation from you that ECS was set up to sell their gas, and 2) a start date for a sale with some advanced notice. I would then have conferred with operations to see if it would be possible to move the entire 363,000 in December. I did not expect ENA to arrange the sale before circling back with TW. If I had known that you were about to close a sale, I could have arranged to be pulled out of my meetings Tuesday afternoon. I have advised Patti Sullivan that TW is able to deliver 25,000/d through the end of the month. The balance can be delivered in January. I am confident that things will run smoother in the future.

As with Monday, I ve focused on getting them out as quickly as possible rather than taking extra time to re-organize them by subject.Enron s business has been grouped into three buckets:  Core, Non-core, and Under Review.  Core:  Wholesale energy business in North America and Europe, retail energy, pipelinesNon-core:  Broadband, water, and international assets (i.e. EGAS).  Enron has approx. $8Bn in investments in these assets, and they have produced  dismal  returns.  Enron will be exiting these businesses and will attempt to wind them up in an orderly fashion.  An aggressive divestiture program has been set in motion for these assets.  Under Review:  EGM, EIM.  These businesses are being closely examined to determine whether they have a reasonable chance of long-term viability.  Required resource levels are being carefully studied.  Following review, Enron will move the different portions of these businesses to core or non-core as the analysis dictates.  Approximately $800MM of asset sales are under contract and expected to close in the fourth quarter.  These include a gas LDC in Brazil, EcoElectrica, and our Indian E&P assets.  Enron is in active pursuit of an additional private equity infusion of $500MM-1Bn.  Given the current environment, raising equity in the public markets would be  inefficient , McMahon says.Short-term liquidity is provided by the $3Bn of credit drawn upon a few weeks ago, the $1Bn of new debt, and the $1.5Bn equity infusion from Dynegy.  Longer-term, the proceeds from the sale of PGE will provide liquidity.  Asset sales over the next year will be used to pay down debt.McMahon described the major off-balance-sheet vehicles:Marlin was set up to hold Azurix assets.  It was initially capitalized with $950MM of 144a debt and $125MM of equity (raised from Enron and institutional investors).  The debt is supported by the equity and by Azurix  assets.  Enron is obligated to cover any deficit at the time the debt becomes due on 3/17/03 (the  Enron topup  obligation).  The 3/17/03 date is accelerated in the event that Enron is rated below-investment-grade by any one of the three major agencies.  The primary asset of Marlin is Wessex Water.  As long as Wessex is worth at least $2.6Bn, there will be no Enron topup required.  If we take a 25% haircut to present book value, Enron will have to provide $650MM in consideration upon retirement of the debt.  This $650MM would hit Enron cash, income, and equity balances.  Osprey contains energy-related assets and  other assets .  It was initially capitalized with $2.4Bn of 144a debt and $220MM in equity (ENE and institutionals).  As with Marlin, the entity is an asset-backed structure with an Enron topup guarantee. The debt is supported by a) the assets; b) $1Bn of convertible preferred ENE (convertible into 50MM shares of ENE common); and c) additional ENE common as needed for topup.  Assuming the same 25% hypothetical haircut to current book value, Enron would have to deliver approx. $600MM of topup funds--which would hit ENE cash, income, and equity.  The debt must be retired by 9/17/02, with the same cut-to-junk early trigger provision as Marlin.  Yosemite and the Credit-Linked Notes are predominantly commodity transactions entered into with  large financial institutions .  The underlying transactions are already on Enron s balance sheet.  McMahon says that there is no Enron share obligation related to these instruments.Dynegy has reviewed all of these vehicles, McMahon says.Our 10Q will be filed five days late.  The 10Q will include all of this detail regarding the off-balance-sheet vehicles.The special committee investigation is still ongoing.  The committee meets 2-3 times/week, sometimes more often.  The outside auditors (D&T) and external counsel hired by the committee are working  virtually 7 days a week .  Lay estimates that it will take the committee several more weeks to complete its investigation.McMahon says it s  way too early to tell  if any asset writedowns are called for.  That analysis is underway, but it will not be complete for some time.  Osprey contains the European power projects (Trakya and Saarlux), some North American merchant investments, and some Brazilian assets.  Under the merger agreement, Enron cannot dispose of assets representing more than 15% of the balance sheet without Dynegy approval.  However, an appendix to the agreement holds a list of assets that are specifically permitted to be sold without Dynegy approval.  Broadband is expected to be fully wound up  sometime over the course of the next year .  (Did not catch this part clearly).  The ENE topup obligation for Marlin (represented by ENE common that would have to be delivered) will be converted into an obligation for an equivalent amount of DYN shares upon closing.  $1.9Bn of debt is carried at the Azurix level.  Current book value of the Osprey assets is $2.1Bn.  No Dynegy outs other than the previously discussed general MAC clause and the $3.5Bn legal liability clause.  Yosemite and the Credit-Linked notes are functionally equivalent to ENE senior unsecured debt (this section somewhat unclear).  The underlying transactions represented volumes of  crude oil and gas .  The transactions relate to the  physical movement  of these commodities.  The swaps related to Yosemite and the CLNs would be financially settled.  Whalley was asked about the return of trading business to normal volumes.  He said that he cannot yet give an update on the progress of customers returning to our longer-term products.  Acknowledges that a few anxious customers put long-term deals on hold last week.  Says that our first focus is on getting our short-term business back up to normal levels.  It will be  a couple of weeks  before we re able to give an update on the comfort levels of our customers regarding long-term deals with us.  McMahon:  There hasn t been a major relaxation of credit requirements by our customers--credit requirements continue to follow strict contractual provisions as called for in our individual agreements with our various customers.  But  we have seen a return of some of the transactions, some of the flows. Whalley says that we re hoping to see a return to more normal trading levels late this week or early next week.Lay says that cost cuts will be made across of all of our businesses.  The situation gives us an opportunity to review our entire cost structure, he says.  The cuts will certainly be deeper in our non-core businesses.  Whalley then quickly interjects (some might say interrrupts) with a clarification that there are no plans to reduce the size of our North American energy trading business.  We will be looking at, perhaps, streamlining some of our processes and making prudent adjustments, but there are no plans to reduce the size of the business.McMahon:  ""The company is overlevered; that s a fact.""--hence our pursuit of additional equity.McMahon mentions that business was better at the start of this week than at the end of last week.ENE had approx. $1Bn in cash as of 9/30, which McMahon points out would be unusual for us.  As before, give me a call at 3-3055 if you d like more color.Patrick Tucker"

Do we have any interests that would warrant more than a plain intervention?  Let me know if you want a copy of the original filing, with maps, etc.INSIDE FERC-October 29, 2001WILLIAMS PUTS MEAT ON THE BONES OF WESTERN FRONTIER PROJECT DESIGNTouting a need for more pipeline capacity linking the ""prolific"" supply basins of the central Rockiesand increasingly hungry Mid-Continent markets, The Williams Cos. Inc. last week took the next step byfiling for authorization to build and operate the Western Frontier project.The sponsor has in hand four negotiated-rate deals for long-term service covering roughly two-thirdsof the 540,000 Dt/day of project design capacity, it told FERC in an Oct. 24 certificate application(CP02-11). Williams wants to have the $366 million project up and running by Nov. 1, 2003; itasked the commission to issue a final certificate by Dec. 11, 2002, so that it can commence constructionby the following April.Williams unveiled initial plans for Western Frontier early last summer (IF, 9 July, 14) and held an openseason in June and July. To carry gas from the Power River, Big Horn, Wind River and Green River basins- estimated to hold 173 Tcf of potential and recoverable reserves - the new 30-inch-diameter mainlinewould run 398 miles, starting at the Cheyenne Hub and ending at an interconnection with the system ofaffiliate Williams Gas Pipelines Central Inc. in Beaver County, Okla. Characterizing the Cheyenne Hub as""a liquid point of supply,"" Williams asserted that ""presently, supply capability to the hub has outpacedtransportation capacity away from the hub to market areas due to insufficient pipeline infrastructure.""Along the way, the Western Frontier mainline would make another interconnection with WilliamsCentral as well as with Northern Natural Gas Co., ANR Pipeline Co., Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of Americaand Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Co., ""thus providing multiple avenues for gas produced in the centralRockies to be transported throughout the Mid-Continent using the existing pipeline grid.""To ""further enhance its supply options,"" the sponsor wants to build a 9.7-mile lateral from themainline to the Wattenberg gas processing plant east of Denver to tap the Denver-Julesberg basin. Roundingout the project design are two new compressor stations, the 10,000-horsepower Chalk Bluff station tobe constructed at the Cheyenne Hub and the 20,000-hp Denver station to be built in Adams County, Colo.Following the open season, Williams hammered out precedent agreements with Marathon Oil Co.(75,000 Dt/day), Williams Energy Marketing and Trading Co. (200,000 Dt/day), Utilicorp United Inc.(15,000 Dt/day) and Entergy Power Generation Corp. (75,000 Dt/day). The initial term for the deals is 10years, except for Marathon which committed to a five-year term with an option to extend it an additionaltwo years, said the application.""Other shippers have expressed serious interest for the remaining capacity on Western Frontier, andactive negotiations are moving forward with these potential shippers,"" said the application, adding thatWilliams was ""confident . . . that the remaining capacity will be committed in the upcoming months.""With the addition of compression, the project could ""facilitate relatively inexpensive expansions toaccommodate future market growth,"" the sponsor told FERC. And that may well be necessary, it continued,pointing to ""stagnant to declining supply"" in the Mid-Continent basins coupled with ""projected demandincreases."" As in many areas of the country, ""much of the anticipated demand increase is attributed toinstallation and operation of . . . gas-fired electrical generation,"" it said. The 11,439 Mw of ""active wintergenerating capacity"" in the combined service areas of Western Frontier and Williams Central is expected tomore than double by 2004, said Williams.The application seeks negotiated rate authority for the project operator, Western Frontier PipelineCo. LLC, and approval of initial recourse rates. The maximum daily reservation rate under schedule FTSwould be 35?/Dt for contract demand in Zone 1 and 79.4?/Dt in Zone 2.Under the negotiated deals reached with the four ""anchor"" shippers, Utilicorp and Entergy would pay acombined reservation and commodity rate of 25?/Dt at a 100% load factor for Zone 1 service to theWilliams Central Hugoton station in Kansas, while WEM&T would pay a combined rate of 30?/Dt forZone 2 transportation to the Williams Central system in Oklahoma and Marathon would pay 32?/Dt underthe shorter contract for Zone 2 service to interconnects with ANR, Panhandle and Williams Central inOklahoma. All transportation would originate at the Cheyenne Hub."

80967,2001-11-26 09:16:21,"This is an alert that FERC will be more critical in the future of negotiated rate deals.  The orders discussed below dealt with buyout provisions in negotiated rate deals that Tennessee, ANR and Columbia had done.  These provisions had previously been permitted as negotiated rates, but FERC has decided that there is ""significant potential for undue discrimination"" and the recourse rates do not provide an adequate alternative.   Thus, anything in a negotiated rate deal that is not strictly rate-related will most likely be subject to intense scrutiny.FERC ADDS ANOTHER LAYER TO POLICY ON NEGOTIATED-RATE AUTHORITYActing on a series of contract-specific cases, FERC last week sharpened its policy on what is, and isnot, allowed under negotiated rates. In further defining its policy, the commission continued to leanheavily on the ""linchpin"" of negotiated-rate authority - that a customer not willing or able to negotiate adeal must always have the option of obtaining needed capacity under cost-based recourse rates.During discussion of the orders, Chairman Pat Wood III said it was ""important to keep in mind, as werush into the brave new world on the gas side,"" that ""all customers must be treated on a nondiscriminatorybasis by pipelines."" Last week s proclamation should be considered ""a reaffirmation of that nondiscriminatorytrend,"" he asserted.In representative language, the commission said it wants to ensure that parties ""are clear about contractingpractices that we find unacceptable because they present a significant potential for undue discrimination and thosethat we find acceptable because they can be permitted without substantial risk"" of such unequal treatment.FERC declared that a ""key factor"" in determining whether a negotiated provision is considered an""appropriate material deviation"" from a pipeline s filed tariff schedule is the extent to which recourse ratesprovide ""adequate alternatives"" to other shippers.In cases involving rates negotiated by ANR Pipeline Co. (GT01-25, RP99-301), Tennessee Gas PipelineCo. (RP96-312, et al.) and Columbia Gas Transmission Corp. (CP01-70), the commission ruled that thebuyout provisions are not allowed unless they are offered to all shippers as part of the pipelines  generallyavailable tariffs.The provisions at issue allow customers to buy out or terminate their contract demand levels prior tothe end of the deals. While the commission previously has held that such provisions can be included in anegotiated-rate package, ""we have reconsidered that holding"" because similar buyout opportunities arenot available to more traditional shippers operating under recourse rates, it said in the Tennessee order.Where a customer is seeking service for a set contract term and quantity, recourse service provides an""adequate alternative,"" the commission observed. ""However, if the customer desires a special contractdemand reduction or early termination right not provided in the generally applicable tariff, the availabilityof service at the recourse rate does not provide an adequate substitute, since recourse service would notinclude any such provision."" A shipper obtaining such a provision would be insulated from a certaindegree of risk, giving it ""an advantage over recourse-rate shippers,"" the commission pointed out.""A shipper s right to reduce, or terminate, its contract demand before the expiration of its contract is avaluable right, since it can enable the shipper to avoid significant liability for future reservation charges,""FERC said, adding that ""such a valuable right must be granted in a not unduly discriminatory manner.""Requiring pipelines to file generally applicable tariff provisions setting forth the conditions underwhich they will offer contract demand reduction rights ""is the best means of assuring that those rights willbe negotiated"" in a fair manner, FERC reasoned. Once approved, the tariff language ""will require thepipeline to grant similar rights to similarly situated customers.""Commissioner Linda Breathitt applauded the policy shift, characterizing it as a much-needed shot inthe arm for a program that had become ""muddled."" Through a ""tortured line of cases,"" FERC s definitionsof allowable contracting practices were ""obscured,"" Breathitt said in welcoming the new ""common-sense""approach. The ""tug of war"" that parties have engaged in over the past few years ""really hasn t served ourobjective of ensuring that nondiscriminatory rates and service"" are available to all shippers, she said."

Unlike any other proposal before it, it seeks toweave into one workable solution, the concerns raised by shippers in theirinitial and reply comments filed in the Order 637 proceeding, as well asaddress the 3 complaints.  It is a share-the-pain proposal among CD -Converted FR - and El Paso.  Under it, FR shippers would convert to CDs atlevels reflecting actual usage over the past 5 years, weighted to thepresent. It assures each westward flowing firm shipper, based on the curren=tphysical mainline capacity (including L. 2000), 93.1%(winter) and 94.2%(summer) of their contractual entitlement.  On a daily basis, all westwardFT shippers are assured of receiving approximately 60% of their 93.1 and94.2% allocation from the San Juan.  FT-2 shippers would continue to beserved off the top.  This Strawman adopts the in-line pooling methodologyset forth in SoCal Gas  initial comments.  It includes North and Southsystem segmentation rights, and narrowly defined demand charge credits forunprovided capacity as long as there is a shortfall.  Provision is made toencourage turn-back of capacity and to have capacity under expired contract=sdedicated by El Paso to meeting the approximately 7% shortfall. Provision i=salso made to treat each primary delivery point as a receipt point, and togive priority to Alternate Receipt- to- Primary Delivery point in thesystemwide scheduling process, all intended to encourage a strongsupplemental market to meet peak seasonal needs.This Strawman Alternative is not filed as an offer of settlement, but as abasis for a merits decision, eliminating the need for lengthy evidentiaryhearings, and providing certainty and flexibility to the system onceimplemented.  Alternatively, we have left it to the Commission to decidewhether other procedures should be adopted.  Because it is a motion, it maybe responded to within 15 days of filing.  SRP strongly urges each shipperand state commission to contact SRP for answers to any questions beforetaking a position in response to the motion.  Any shipper that has question=sbut does not seek answers, but merely sticks to their litigation positionwill only be delaying resolution. This proposal is a viablecompromise...everyone gains and everyone loses something.  That is why itworks.  We look forward to hearing from you and reading your constructivecomments.

81802,2001-11-13 13:10:21,"Update - this afternoon Kris, Sarah, Gloria and I talked with Bob Detonte and Carol Consolver from SoCal.  They will provide Kris with information reconciling imbalance data.  They clarified that imbalance trading will be reflected immediately, thus lessening our exposure.  They agreed to several changes in the contract including procedures for posting of margin.  They agreed to consider our requests to increase imbalance tolerance from $2.5 million to $10 million, and to scale the requirement according to our credit rating.  We expect an answer on these latter issues later today or early tomorrow.  The first reaction was that $10 million may be a ""little too rich""."
81809,2001-11-08 13:05:09,"Stephanie:  Confirming our phone conversation today, based on my reading of the Transco order and the PGT order, the FERC relied on a different standard in the Transco case (the 1995 Pricing Policy Statement) than they used in the PGT case (the 1999 Policy Statement on Certification of New Interstate Natural Gas Pipeline Facilities).  The 1995 Policy Statement said that, when the roll-in increased rates to existing shippers by less than 5%, the pipeline needed to make only a general showing of system benefits, and FERC said that Transco had satisfied that showing.  The 1999 Policy Statement, however, has a threshold requirement for expansion projects requiring that there can be no subsidization from existing customers - in other words, no increase in costs of any kind.  The PGT order found that there was a possibility that fuel costs could increase for existing shippers; therefore, PGT had to establish a surcharge mechanism to subject expansion shippers to an incremental fuel charge for fuel costs above those that would apply absent the new compression.  If the fuel costs do not increase, then there will be no surcharge. "

Their pipeline system is not set up to take advantage of the regasified LNG to supply their core customers in Portland but they would consider buying directly from us for customers in the Port Westward, St. Helens, Longview area if the price was right, i.e., the lower of Sumas and Stanfield price MINUS some discount from the NW Pipeline postage stamp tariff.They perceive some risk in relying on an LNG supply with price formula linked to Nymex that would not provide a floor for the LNG producer.They would like to see the LNG terminal in southern Oregon, where the NW pipeline system telescopes down to 10 inches, but realize that the terminal would be lost somewhere around Coos Bay with over 150 miles to go to connect with the PGT line across the Coastal Range and the Cascades, through an area of strong environmental concerns.At this point, the best option for Enron seems to be (pending positive report on navigational issues on the Columbia from Golder): a terminal close to the N/W Pipeline in the Port Westward/Longview areaselling gas directly to local customers (i.e., bypassing NW P/L transportation charges)selling rest of gas on NW P//LEventually, we will need to talk to the Kelso Beaver (KB) Pipeline which operates the small diameter line to Port Westward.Please give me a call if you have any questions.Best,Z"

I would like to take the next step with them and assuming we get paper executed for ECC and ENA ( which is pending).... I want to give them TRADE ACCESS TO EOL.  Cumulative unsecured exposure would be about $300,000/day. ( estimated ) and  I would try to get the payments from them to us made on the 5th business day vs the 25th business day following delivery. Our master will give us rights for reasonable financial assurances but not definative collateral threshold amount, infact we should keep this at zero for both sides until the air clears. All transactions will come through EOL and the products being sold by ENA, ECC will be cash or rest of month, AECO, Sumas, Malin or PG&E Citygate.The bottom line on this is do we want to enter into Gas related cash transactions that increase of exposure on a receivables basis to PG&E.  Commercially, I believe they are someone we want to do business with and we can increase deal flow on EOL for some Canadian and U.S. products.

FYI -----Original Message-----From: 	Lynn, Derek  Sent:	Wednesday, October 31, 2001 11:48 AMTo:	Oh, GrantSubject:	ENE compsGrant, ENE trades at 7x 2001 expected recurring earnings and 0.9 times book value.  This is far lower than a quick industry average of 15.5 times 2001 expected earnings and 2.8 times current book value (industry includes Duke, EL Paso, Williams, Dynegy, Kinder Morgan, and Aquila).  I think what these ratios demonstrate is the risk of the unknown that is being priced into ENE.  For example the current price to book seems like a suspect ratio to use for ENE given that it is unclear what is on our books and what else needs to be written down.  If you look at ENE on a price to earnings after non-recurring items for 2001 it looks far less attractive at 22.9 times.  If you take ENE s earnings after ""non-recurring"" items and slap on the industry average multiple of 15.5 times ENE s share price is $8.51 (ouch).  Now obviously not everything in the non-recurring events are actually recurring but there is talk of some wholesale losses being buried in the ""non-recurring"" loss.ENE s long-term debt to equity is 0.9 times but if you include all the off balance sheet leverage and the leverage inherent in our trading business the true number is significantly higher than 0.9 times.  On a positive note the ENE s debt is trading higher today (price not yield).Here is a spreadsheet from Bloomberg with the S&P pipelines sub sector P/Es, and P/Bs. and dividend per share (ENE s is 4%, nothing like a share price falling by 85% to get that div yield up).  I have also attached the latest Wall Street Journal article touting Berkshire, Royal Dutch, and GE as potential suitors (do you think Buffet can understand ENE?).Hope this helps--Derek"

84692,2001-11-26 09:16:21,"This is an alert that FERC will be more critical in the future of negotiated rate deals.  The orders discussed below dealt with buyout provisions in negotiated rate deals that Tennessee, ANR and Columbia had done.  These provisions had previously been permitted as negotiated rates, but FERC has decided that there is ""significant potential for undue discrimination"" and the recourse rates do not provide an adequate alternative.   Thus, anything in a negotiated rate deal that is not strictly rate-related will most likely be subject to intense scrutiny.FERC ADDS ANOTHER LAYER TO POLICY ON NEGOTIATED-RATE AUTHORITYActing on a series of contract-specific cases, FERC last week sharpened its policy on what is, and isnot, allowed under negotiated rates. In further defining its policy, the commission continued to leanheavily on the ""linchpin"" of negotiated-rate authority - that a customer not willing or able to negotiate adeal must always have the option of obtaining needed capacity under cost-based recourse rates.During discussion of the orders, Chairman Pat Wood III said it was ""important to keep in mind, as werush into the brave new world on the gas side,"" that ""all customers must be treated on a nondiscriminatorybasis by pipelines."" Last week s proclamation should be considered ""a reaffirmation of that nondiscriminatorytrend,"" he asserted.In representative language, the commission said it wants to ensure that parties ""are clear about contractingpractices that we find unacceptable because they present a significant potential for undue discrimination and thosethat we find acceptable because they can be permitted without substantial risk"" of such unequal treatment.FERC declared that a ""key factor"" in determining whether a negotiated provision is considered an""appropriate material deviation"" from a pipeline s filed tariff schedule is the extent to which recourse ratesprovide ""adequate alternatives"" to other shippers.In cases involving rates negotiated by ANR Pipeline Co. (GT01-25, RP99-301), Tennessee Gas PipelineCo. (RP96-312, et al.) and Columbia Gas Transmission Corp. (CP01-70), the commission ruled that thebuyout provisions are not allowed unless they are offered to all shippers as part of the pipelines  generallyavailable tariffs.The provisions at issue allow customers to buy out or terminate their contract demand levels prior tothe end of the deals. While the commission previously has held that such provisions can be included in anegotiated-rate package, ""we have reconsidered that holding"" because similar buyout opportunities arenot available to more traditional shippers operating under recourse rates, it said in the Tennessee order.Where a customer is seeking service for a set contract term and quantity, recourse service provides an""adequate alternative,"" the commission observed. ""However, if the customer desires a special contractdemand reduction or early termination right not provided in the generally applicable tariff, the availabilityof service at the recourse rate does not provide an adequate substitute, since recourse service would notinclude any such provision."" A shipper obtaining such a provision would be insulated from a certaindegree of risk, giving it ""an advantage over recourse-rate shippers,"" the commission pointed out.""A shipper s right to reduce, or terminate, its contract demand before the expiration of its contract is avaluable right, since it can enable the shipper to avoid significant liability for future reservation charges,""FERC said, adding that ""such a valuable right must be granted in a not unduly discriminatory manner.""Requiring pipelines to file generally applicable tariff provisions setting forth the conditions underwhich they will offer contract demand reduction rights ""is the best means of assuring that those rights willbe negotiated"" in a fair manner, FERC reasoned. Once approved, the tariff language ""will require thepipeline to grant similar rights to similarly situated customers.""Commissioner Linda Breathitt applauded the policy shift, characterizing it as a much-needed shot inthe arm for a program that had become ""muddled."" Through a ""tortured line of cases,"" FERC s definitionsof allowable contracting practices were ""obscured,"" Breathitt said in welcoming the new ""common-sense""approach. The ""tug of war"" that parties have engaged in over the past few years ""really hasn t served ourobjective of ensuring that nondiscriminatory rates and service"" are available to all shippers, she said."

Sunday, we got the tree out of the closet and set that up in theliving room.  Our plan was to do a little bit every night.  ByThanksgiving, we would have a beautifully decorated house.  On Monday,Bryan put the lights on the tree.  Then I started unwrapping some of theornaments.... just to look at them.  Well, after I unwrapped *all* of theornaments, we decided to finish trimming the tree.  Bryan was hanging backand letting me do most of the decorating.  Though I did notice that one ofthe first ornaments that he put on the tree was my heart shaped Nicoleornament.  After we finished, we sat in the glow of the big bulb lights andadmired our tree.  That was when Bryan informed me that I did not find myNEW ornament.  He had put something new on one of the trees.  (we have acharlie brown tree in the bedroom and the big tree in the living room.)  Icould not find anything new on the charlie brown tree so I moved to the bigtree.After surveying the big tree for a few moments, the little girl in me said,""Look for a ring, look for a ring"".  But the practical side of me said,""Find the ornament"".  Well, just about then I found a beautiful diamondring hanging from the heart shaped Nicole ornament.  My engagement ring hadbeen on the tree the entire time.  I was so focused on the decorating thatI never saw it.  Bryan has since been teasing me that any other woman wouldhave known right away that there was a diamond ring on the tree.I am very happy and excited to tell everyone that Bryan and I are engagedto be married.  We do not have a date, time, place or even a ctiy yet.  Ijust couldn t wait to tell everyone.  I know that I will be wearing a bigsmile for a long, long time!Happy Holidays, Nicole"

85847,2001-12-19 07:55:49,"Stephanie, Transwestern has been in discussions with ENA since very early December regarding the sale of the Enron Compression Services gas. The ECS off take is supposed to be 11,000 per day. The fact that ECS was not able to nominate their gas has been problematic for Transwestern in that it causes our line pack to be higher than it otherwise would be. When we began discussions, we were open to the idea of getting the full volume out of our system by the end of the month. If a nomination could have been made that resulted in a sale starting at the beginning of this week, ECS could have sold the entire 363,000 in December. At some point, it becomes unrealistic to expect to be able to do that. It has taken ECS so long to arrange for an agent that a now we are looking at selling the entire volume in just 12 days (~30,000/day). I was expecting the following two things from ENA, 1) confirmation from you that ECS was set up to sell their gas, and 2) a start date for a sale with some advanced notice. I would then have conferred with operations to see if it would be possible to move the entire 363,000 in December. I did not expect ENA to arrange the sale before circling back with TW. If I had known that you were about to close a sale, I could have arranged to be pulled out of my meetings Tuesday afternoon. I have advised Patti Sullivan that TW is able to deliver 25,000/d through the end of the month. The balance can be delivered in January. I am confident that things will run smoother in the future.

I know in the past, prior to their taking over ownership, I would remind them each year that a particular document was requried.  I figured that when they became owners, they didnt need me anymore.  Louie, you are right, Phil Moyer was the environmental contact for WGR and he was the one I would contact and apprise.  It just so happens that I have copies of previous annual submittals from WGR for the Gomez facility  when the facility was under our ownership, their responsibility.  I even have a copy of the Title V Permit.  When I was told that we no longer owned the faclity, I sent all information I had to WGR, but kept copies of the stuff I had, just in case.  I can send it one more time if you want me too.  Let me know....."
88791,2001-12-14 08:56:28,"Steve, what I have on my board is that when cubix did the test for 703 the engine load was 89%.  If Cubix is willing to provide us a report that shows the load on 703 to be greater than 90%, we ve satisified the compliance testing for 703.  Id like to have a copy of the revised report to submit to the Air Quality Bureau for their records and the facility should also have copy.  My records show that the ceiling for using unit 702 is 68% load.  Under our agreement with the AQB, we can operate unit 702 ONLY UP TO A 68% LOAD.  Above this, we need to bring in Cubix or have a portable test completed to raise the ceiling of operation.  One other thing, there seem to be some confusion about which units are required to be tested at station 7.  I have a copy of the approval from the AQB about allowing us to test units 702 and 703 instead of 701 and 702.  Ill pass a copy of this letter on to anyone who needs it. "

I will be contacting you in the near future about coming out and going through the permits to assign responsibilities between you and me.  If you get some time, I would suggest that you look over each permit as there is additional recordkeeping and reporting above that which is on your existing permit.  the old permit will expire when the facility begins operation of the turbine.  For Station 4, if a turbine is not installed at your location, this new permit wont apply.

Guess I typed it in by mistake. (age does that to you sometimes).  Yes, things are stressful, but as you eluded to God doesnt give His kids a spirit of fear, but confidence that He is in control.  I never thought I d see the Enron empire tumble, but when you torture and strangle a corporation hard enough and long enough, eventually it gives up and surrenders.  There is a push underway to isolate the pipelines from the Enron umbrella and make all business units with money making assets separate from the rest of Enron.  Transwestern is definately a money making asset, and that is what may keep me afloat.  Well see.  Anyway, as long as I keep my focus on Jesus and keep reminding myself of that which is important (family and health) I know Ill come through all of this.Sorry to hear that there is the word ""reorganization""  in Hess.  this kind of stuff generally never does anything but upset employees and create a period of time when nobody is productive.  I hate this kind of stuff. I know that change is inevitable, but so disruptive.  Ill keep you in prayer. Isnt it great to have the confidence and assurance that we serve a big enough God, that He can handle all our problems?  Keep the faith......my friend and focus on the eternal.

I spoke with Danny Collier of the EPA today, Friday, November 30, 2001 and he has instructed me that the EPA is to receive copies of all monthly water well sampling for C/S 3,4, and 5 in addition to sending the monthly sampling results to Yolanda Barney of the Navajo Nation. Although Yolanda is the primary recipient, the EPA becomes secondary as they have the responsibility for oversight of Indian Lands environmental issues.  Danny said that the EPA would eventually phase themselves out of the Navajo s business but until they do, he is requesting copies of all sampling data.  I asked him if we could fax him the monthly reports and he indiacted that it would be OK to do so.  His fax number is (415) 947-3549.  I will keep you apprised of any future changes in the distribution of the water sampling reports."

SoCal presented a third quarter invoce of their PCB management and disposal activities for which Transwestern is responsible for $120,602.19 (86%).  All charges were appropriate and considered normal operating expenses for PCB activities in California.  On a similar note, while speaking to Ralph Komai, PCB person for SoCal, some interesting things are happening on their system and are presented below:SoCal is beginning to notice accumulations of PCB pipeline liquids on portions of their system which has been considered PCB clean.  It is these portions of their pipeline for which they have been petitioning EPA to declassify.  These liquids are not new liquids introductions into the SoCal system but historic liquids that have laid in their pipeline. Because of the fact that Transwestern is not seeing liquids accumulations at the compressor stations upstream of Needles, we know that liquids are not being sent inot California.  Due to the increase of Transwestern gas into the SoCal system, it appears  the gas is sweeping old historic liquids into these new pipeline areas.    SoCal will be meeting with PG&E within the next couple of weeks to discuss the discovery of pipeline liquids at an interconnect where SoCal provides natural gas to PG&E.The PCB concentrations are less than 5 ppm.  The location of this  interconnect is near Bakersfield, Ca.Southwest Gas has requested that 2 filter separators be installed at 2 interconnects where they receive gas from SoCal.  As you know, Transwetern supplies gas to SoCal who then provides gas to Southwest.   The price of the 2 separators will be approx. $33,000 plus installation charges.  Ralph stated that theses charges will show up on the first or second quarter of 2002.

I have spoken to Roger Kohn,EPA permit engineer,  about the possibility of not doing the turbine installation at station 4 only due to what you described as not enough market commitment.  My plans are to hold off on making any decisions and have the EPA issue the station 4 permit.  If we do not initiate any construction pertaining to the turbine or auxillary generators, then the new permit doesnt apply and we can still operate under the existing permit which was issued about 2 years ago.  In Enron, 6 months is an eternity and who knows what will happern then?  By having the permit, but not constructing, we will be  OK.  If we decide to do the turbine project  within the period of time that the permit is valid, then were ahead of the game.  If not, and a more firm decision is made to not do anything in the future, Ill contact EPA and request termination of the permit.  Usually, the agency places a caveot that if construction does not proceed in a specified time then the permit automatically cancels itself and the facility must comply witht he conditions of the existing permit for the facility..

Simply put, we need quotes on every forward term for which we currently have positions.  It seems that the best way to obtain relevant information would be to ask for the following:1.  Annual quotes (a quote for 2003, a quote for 2004, etc.)2.  Seasonal quotes (winter  03, summer  04, etc.)In short, try to obtain pricing to match any positions which we currently have in the books.  I know that this will be difficult to accomplish, but please do what you can.  We need these quotes for every day starting with Nov 28 through today.  We will continue to need daily updates for the immediate future.Also, I am aware that our current position doesn t give us much stroke to ask for a lot of pricing data.  However, this information is critical as it will be needed for calculation of termination values.  Please do whatever you can to obtain as much data as possible.  Additionally, we need to get quotes from as many different brokers as possible to help verify pricing.

But in the wake of post-agree=ment disclosures by Enron that its future earnings are likely to be substan=tially less than expected, the company s stock has been hammered. In 1 p.m.= trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday, Enron shares fell 30 cen=ts to $4.71. The stock is down 94% so far this year and far short of the pe=r-share takeover price. Dynegy shares rose 64 cents to $40.40.Although Dynegy and Enron both say they are going ahead with the deal under= the terms negotiated, Dynegy does appear to have other options. The agreem=ent with Enron contains a broad ""material adverse change"" clause as well as= some specific trigger points that could be invoked.=20Dynegy officials performed ""due diligence"" throughout the holiday weekend, =seeking to learn more about the intimate workings of Enron, which has suffe=red a series of damaging blows. Since mid-October, Enron has disclosed that= some of its officers participated in personally enriching deals that moved= assets off Enron s balance sheet, for a time, to several private partnersh=ips. Those deals are now the subject of a Securities and Exchange Commissio=n investigation. Past treatment of some of those deals has been termed an ""=accounting error"" by Enron and it twice has rejiggered its earnings since O=ct. 16. At one point, Enron restated downwards nearly five years of earning=s.=20An Enron spokeswoman said the company was proceeding in the belief that the= deal would be completed as agreed. Dynegy spokesman John Sousa said the tw=o sides are forging ahead although he acknowledged that the walk-away provi=sions ""are broad, by design, to ensure adequate protection for Dynegy share=holders."" Shareholders of both firms must still vote on the merger agreemen=t.=20Clauses related to a ""material adverse change,"" also known as a ""material a=dverse effect,"" have been the focus of much attention among merger professi=onals this year, due, in part, to the stock market s fluctuations and the e=conomic slowdown that have caused some buyers to reconsider planned acquisi=tions.=20But such clauses rarely are invoked by a buyer or seller because they are c=onsidered extremely difficult to prove. Both parties typically are reluctan=t to lay out specific terms for canceling a deal, much the way a bride and =groom often balk at negotiating a prenuptial agreement since it appears to =envisage a breakup of the marriage even before it begins.=20Furthermore, a key court case earlier this year affirmed widespread views t=hat a buyer can t easily walk away from a merger. In that case, meat-proces=sing concern Tyson Foods Inc. sought to cancel a planned acquisition of mea=t-packer IBP Inc. due to a drop in IBP s earnings and a write-down of an IB=P subsidiary. But a Delaware judge refused to let Tyson cancel the pact, sa=ying Tyson had been aware of the cyclical nature of IBP s business and the =accounting issue.=20In a lengthy June 18 opinion, Delaware Chancery Court Vice Chancellor Leo E=. Strine Jr. wrote that "" . . . the important thing is whether the company =has suffered a Material Adverse Effect in its business or results of operat=ions that is consequential to the company s earnings power over a commercia=lly reasonable period, which one would think would be measured in years rat=her than months.""=20That interpretation has created ripples in the deal-making community, promp=ting some transactions to include more details about circumstances under wh=ich deals can be terminated. Since the Sept. 11 attacks, for example, a han=dful of merger agreements have specified that future terrorist activity wou=ld qualify as a ""material adverse change,"" or MAC.=20A key issue for any firm alleging there has been a material adverse change =is ""whether the new facts go to the guts of the strategic opportunity or is= it just a hiccup,"" says Meredith Brown, co-chairman of the mergers and acq=uisitions group at law firm Debevoise & Plimpton in New York. He adds that =a court ""may be skeptical"" if Dynegy claimed that Enron s post-merger agree=ment disclosures were a surprise.=20The Enron-Dynegy merger agreement includes several triggers permitting eith=er side to seek termination. Enron can quit the deal if it receives a subst=antially better offer, although it is prohibited from soliciting one. In su=ch a case, it could be required to pay a $350 million ""topper fee"" to Dyneg=y and its co-investor, ChevronTexaco Inc.=20Dynegy can alter the deal if Enron faces ""pending or threatened"" litigation= liabilities that are ""reasonably likely"" to cost Enron $2 billion. If thos=e liabilities hit $3.5 billion ""an Enron material event will be deemed to h=ave occurred,"" presumably allowing Dynegy to call the whole thing off. In s=ome situations, Dynegy would be liable for a $350 million fee, as well.=20Karen Denne, the Enron spokeswoman, said her firm doesn t believe that loss=es arising from the normal course of business would qualify as a material e=vent. The liability must result from litigation. Currently, the company fac=es more than a dozen shareholder suits alleging breach of fiduciary duty by= officers and directors, issuing false and misleading reports and other off=enses.=20Deal makers who aren t involved in the combination say the steep drop in En=ron s stock price since the merger agreement was signed wouldn t by itself =give Dynegy the ability to cancel the pact or force Enron to renegotiate it=s terms. Instead, they say, Dynegy would likely have to prove that Enron s =worsening financial condition was an unanticipated event, which could be di=fficult in light of the company s highly publicized problems and Dynegy s f=requent statement that it clearly understands Enron s businesses. Still, th=ere is another standard clause in the merger document that would allow Dyne=gy to terminate the deal if ""any representation or warranty of Enron shall =have become untrue.""=20Other energy companies have abandoned deals following a widening gap in sto=ck prices that changed an acquisition premium. Western Resources Inc. of To=peka, Kansas last week sued Public Service Co. of New Mexico seeking hundre=ds of millions of dollars in damages after it failed to buy Western s utili=ties. The lawsuit accused Public Service of breaching its ""duty of good fai=th and fair dealing"" and said the New Mexico company tried to ""sabotage"" th=e deal as the two companies  stock prices diverged. Public Service denies t=he accusations.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

All Rights Reserved. =09The Corporation: AcquisitionsThe Other Instant Powerhouse in Energy TradingBy Louise Lee in San Mateo, Calif.11/26/2001BusinessWeek96(Copyright 2001 McGraw-Hill, Inc.)It s not easy being No. 4. Despite a $35 billion merger completed in Octobe=r, ChevronTexaco Corp. is still not one of the oil superpowers. Nor, at mor=e than $90 billion a year in revenues, is it a scrappy little guy. So Chair=man David J. O Reilly has been searching for a strategy beyond just drillin=g for more oil and gas.=20Now, he may have something: a big stake in the No. 1 energy-trading company=. Chevron Corp. has owned 26% of Dynegy Inc. since 1996, and with Dynegy s =planned acquisition of Enron Corp., the top energy trader, ChevronTexaco is= making the oil industry s most aggressive push yet into this fast-growing =business. It plans to eventually pump $2.5 billion into the combined Dynegy= and Enron to maintain its 26% stake, and it might raise that share. So, wh=ile ChevronTexaco s much bigger rivals run small in-house trading operation=s, energy trading may soon account for more than 10% of ChevronTexaco s ear=nings. ``Chevron is now positioned to be a leader in the business,   says a=nalyst Arjun Murti at Goldman, Sachs & Co.The deal would certainly dovetail with ChevronTexaco s strategy of becoming= a more integrated energy company, with a hand in everything from pumping o=il at the wellhead to trading natural-gas futures. By acquiring Texaco, Che=vron picked up, for instance, a big refining-and-marketing business --which= should balance out the bad times in oil and gas production, says Eugene No=wak, an analyst at ABN Amro. ``When crude-oil prices are down, they ll have= margin improvements on refining and marketing,   he says. O Reilly and oth=er ChevronTexaco executives declined to comment.=20Until now, Dynegy wasn t a big deal for Chevron. Chevron purchased the stak=e for $700 million when Dynegy was still called NGC Corp., and it filled th=ree of the 14 board seats--positions it will keep. Since then, Chevron has =sold nearly all its domestic natural-gas production to Dynegy. The stake ha=s been a good investment: it is now worth $3 billion, ChevronTexaco says.==20Sitting on $2.9 billion in cash as of the end of the second quarter, Chevro=nTexaco can well afford the Dynegy deal, analysts say. And they expect O Re=illy to use some of that to make more buys; the most likely target is a nat=ural-gas company. Maybe it s not so bad being No. 4.Illustration: Chart: CHEVRON S GROWING CASH HOARD=20Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

CEO Charles L. Watson if he had sat= back and gloated. After all, Watson had watched as his bigger, brasher cro=sstown rival sniffed at Dynegy s more cautious strategy, all the while garn=ering most of the credit for reshaping the energy-trading business.=20Instead, Watson picked up the phone on Oct. 24 and called Enron Chairman, C=EO, and longtime acquaintance Kenneth L. Lay to ask how he could help. Lay =didn t respond immediately, but as Enron s stock continued to plunge and th=e company faced a cash squeeze, it became clear what the only realistic ans=wer could be: Bail us out.So two days later, Lay invited Watson to his River Oaks home near downtown =Houston for breakfast to discuss a deal. Over muffins and ``a bad cup of co=ffee   the next day, Watson recalls, they sketched the outlines, and by 10 =p.m. that night, the investment bankers were called in. On Nov. 9, Dynegy a=nnounced that it would pay about $10 billion, plus the assumption of $13 bi=llion in debt, to buy Enron, which is nearly four times its size. The key t=o the deal was Dynegy s immediate $1.5 billion infusion of cash to shore up= Enron s balance sheet and save its credit rating. The money came from Dyne=gy s 26% owner, ChevronTexaco Corp.=20Without that help, Enron--the seventh-largest U.S. company, based on its $1=00 billion in sales last year--may well have faced bankruptcy. Watson says =that he never would have imagined such an outcome in his wildest dreams. ``=I don t think anybody foresaw the problems [at Enron],   he says. ``It s be=en incredible to watch.  =20Watson, 51, has to make good on what may well be his riskiest investment ye=t. If he can pull it off, the new Dynegy will have revenues of more than $2=00 billion and $90 billion in assets, including more than 22,000 megawatts =of power-generating capacity and 25,000 miles of pipeline. It would control= an estimated 20% to 25% of the energy-trading market, up from about 6% now=.=20That would be sweet vindication for Watson s strategy. Dynegy backs trading= operations with hard assets such as power plants, which allows the company= to guarantee a supply of electricity to a buyer. In contrast, Enron has wo=rked furiously to shed power plants and oil- and gas-generating fields, bel=ieving it could earn higher returns using its trading and technology expert=ise to tap assets owned by others in markets including steel, pulp, and pap=er. IRRESISTIBLE BARGAIN. As Enron s stock slid below $9 from its August, 2=000, high of $90, it became a bargain that Watson couldn t pass up. It woul=d have taken years for Dynegy to build up a market-making operation to matc=h Enron s. Its risk-management systems are top-of-the-line. Enron s commerc=ial-services unit, which manages power supplies for corporate customers suc=h as Wendy s International Inc., is three or four years ahead of Dynegy s, =says Steve Bergstrom, president of Dynegy. Watson says he still plans to ge=t rid of the $8 billion worth of assets Lay had earmarked for sale, includi=ng the Portland (Ore.) General Electric plant and oil and gas assets in Ind=ia. For the $1.5 billion, though, if the deal falls through Dynegy will hav=e the right to Enron s prized Northern Natural Gas pipeline, worth an estim=ated $2.25 billion. And Dynegy can walk away if Enron s legal liabilities e=xceed $3.5 billion.=20Watson firmly believes that Enron suffered from a crisis of confidence, not= a meltdown of its core business. Indeed, Enron s wholesale-trading operati=on earned $2.3 billion last year. Says Watson: ``We know the business. We l=ooked under the hood, and guess what? It s just as strong as we thought it =was.  =20But the trading profits were obscured in recent weeks by Enron s accounting= tricks. The biggest danger for Watson is that there are other time bombs t=icking away. Already, the company has slashed its reported earnings since 1=997 by $591 million, or 20% of its total, to account for controversial part=nerships involving Enron officials. The Securities & Exchange Commission is= still investigating. ``We believe it will take more than just a couple of =weeks and a long-term relationship [between Watson and Lay] to do all the n=ecessary due diligence,   says analyst Carol Coale of Prudential Securities= Inc. Dynegy s Bergstrom counters: ``We re pretty certain that most everyth=ing of material consideration has been disclosed.   If not? The massive ear=nings boost provides ``a high margin of error,   he says. A WANNABE. Of cou=rse, regulators may object to the concentration of trading operations. And =Watson will have to mesh two very different cultures. Enron is known for it=s intense, even cutthroat entrepreneurial spirit. Dynegy s operations are m=ore conservative; some compare it to a fraternity. Dynegy s decision to iss=ue new stock options to some Enron employees may soothe battered egos. It s=hould help, too, that Lay decided not to take the $60 million golden parach=ute he could have received in a buyout. As it is, Lay will not have a manag=ement job with the new company.=20Dynegy often seemed to be an Enron wannabe, following it into online tradin=g and commercial services. Still, Dynegy s 361% stock gains last year eclip=sed Enron s 87% rise, and it rankled some that Lay s execs got more credit.= ``Chuck Watson may not have been in the spotlight, but he has always been =at the forefront of this business,   says Bruce M.

Here s what companies should do-=-and what investors need to knowBy Nanette Byrnes and David Henry=20With Mike McNamee in Washington11/26/2001BusinessWeek76(Copyright 2001 McGraw-Hill, Inc.)In an age when giant earnings write-offs have become commonplace, it s hard= to shock Wall Street. But on Nov. 8, Enron Corp. managed to do it. After y=ears of high-octane growth that had seen earnings surge by up to 24% a year=, the Houston-based energy company acknowledged that results for the past t=hree years were actually overstated by more than a half-billion dollars. It= was confirmation of investors  worst fears. Three weeks earlier, Enron had= announced a big drop in shareholders  equity, sparking fears that its hide=ously complex financial statements were distorting its true performance. Ma=nagement pointed to a number of factors, including a dubious decision to ex=clude the results of three partnerships from its financial statements and a= billion-dollar error several years earlier that had inflated the company s= net worth.=20Enron may be an extreme example of a company whose performance fell far sho=rt of the glowing picture painted by management in its earnings releases, b=ut it is hardly alone. This year, Corporate America is expected to charge o=ff a record $125 billion, much of it for assets, investments, and inventory= that aren t worth as much as management thought (chart, page 79). Even if =companies don t go back and restate earnings, as Enron is doing, those char=ges cast doubt on the record-breaking earnings growth of the late  90s.Not since the 1930s has the quality of corporate earnings been such an issu=e--and so difficult for investors to determine. There s more at stake than =the fortunes of those who bought shares based on misleading numbers. If eve=n the most sophisticated financial minds can t figure out what a company ac=tually earns, that has implications far beyond Enron. U.S. financial market=s have a reputation for integrity that took decades to build. It has made t=he U.S. the gold standard for financial reporting and the preeminent place =to invest. It has also ensured ready access to capital for U.S. corporation=s. That a company such as Enron, a member of the Standard & Poor s 500-stoc=k index and one of the largest companies on the New York Stock Exchange, co=uld fall so far so fast shows how badly that gold standard has been tarnish=ed. ``The profession of auditing and accounting is, in fact, in crisis,   s=ays Paul A. Volcker, former chairman of the Federal Reserve and now one of =the leaders of the International Accounting Standards Board.=20Sometimes, as in the case of Enron, fuzzy numbers result from questionable =decisions in figuring net earnings. More often, though, the earnings chaos =results from a disturbing trend among companies to calculate profits in the=ir own idiosyncratic ways--and an increasing willingness among investors an=d analysts to accept those nonstandard tallies, which appear under a variet=y of names, from ``pro forma   to ``core.   (Enron offers its own such vers=ion. Before investors untangled the importance of Enron s first announcemen=t, its stock rose briefly because it told investors that its ``recurring ne=t income   had met expectations.) The resulting murk makes it difficult to =answer the most basic question in investing: What did my company earn?=20Why calculate a second set of earnings in the first place? Because the numb=ers reached by applying generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) are= woefully inadequate when it comes to giving investors a good sense of a co=mpany s prospects. Many institutional investors, most Wall Street analysts,= and even many accountants say GAAP is irrelevant. ``I don t know anyone wh=o uses GAAP net income anymore for anything,   says Lehman Brothers Inc. ac=counting expert Robert Willens. The problem is that GAAP includes a lot of =noncash charges and one-time expenses. While investors need to be aware of =those charges, they also need a number that pertains solely to the performa=nce of ongoing operations.=20That s what operating earnings are supposed to do. But because they re calc=ulated in an ad hoc manner, with each company free to use its own rules, co=mparisons between companies have become meaningless. ``No investor--certain=ly not any ordinary investor--can read these in a way that s useful,   says= Harvey L. Pitt, chairman of the Securities & Exchange Commission. The SEC =is examining whether new rules are needed to clarify financial reports and =perhaps restrict use of pro formas.=20What s badly needed is a set of rules for calculating operating earnings an=d a requirement to make clear how they relate to net income. In the end, in=vestors need two numbers--a standardized operating number and an audited ne=t-income number--and a clear explanation of how to get from one to the othe=r. ``OUT OF HAND.   A widespread consensus is building to do just that. In =early November, S&P proposed a set of rules for companies to follow when ta=llying operating earnings. Only the week before, the Financial Accounting S=tandards Board, the rulemakers for GAAP, had announced that they, too, woul=d be taking up this issue. Volcker says the International Accounting Standa=rds Board is also seeking a uniform definition of operating earnings.=20``Over the past two or three years, the use of creative earnings measures h=as grown and grown and grown to the point where it has really gotten out of= hand,   says David M. Blitzer, S&P s chief investment strategist. ``Earnin=gs are one of the key measures that anybody looks at when they re trying to= evaluate a company. If people want to use an operating-earnings measure, w=e better all know what we re looking at.  =20Without those standards in place, the gap between earnings according to gen=erally accepted accounting principles and earnings according to Wall Street= is only going to grow wider and more confusing. Look at the variance in ea=rnings per share calculated for the S&P 500 for the third quarter: It s $10=.78 according to Wall Street analysts as tallied by Thomson Financial/First= Call, $9.17 according to S&P, and $6.37 according to numbers reported to t=he SEC under GAAP. (S&P, like BusinessWeek, is owned by The McGraw-Hill Com=panies.)=20The lack of a standard measure can be costly to those who choose wrong. Use= First Call s earnings for the past four quarters and you get a relatively =modest price-earnings ratio of 23 for the S&P 500. But run the numbers usin=g GAAP earnings, and suddenly the market has a far steeper p-e of 38.=20How did we get into this mess? Investors and analysts have been calculating= operating earnings for years, and for years, reasonable people could more =or less agree on how to do it. Then came the dot-com bubble, along with inc=reased pressure from Wall Street for companies to meet their quarterly earn=ings forecasts. Suddenly, companies that hadn t turned a profit by any conv=entional measure started offering ever more inventive earnings variants. Th=ese customized pro forma calculations excluded a grab bag of expenses and a=llowed upstart companies to show a profit. ``TOWER OF BABEL.   Pro forma fo=rmulas vary wildly from company to company and even from quarter to quarter= within the same company, casting doubt on their validity. And these days, =the gulf between net earnings and pro forma earnings is wider than ever. S&=P s tallies fall between the two: S&P s numbers are more systematic than pr=o forma, but they aren t followed widely enough to be a standard. ``Investo=rs are facing a Tower of Babel,   says Robert K. Elliott, former chief of t=he American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) and a retired= KPMG partner. ``It s not standardized, and the numbers are not audited.  ==20That makes it tough to evaluate a company s performance. In the quarter end=ed on Sept. 30, Nortel Networks Corp. offered shareholders at least three e=arnings numbers to choose from. By conservative GAAP accounting, the teleco=mmunications giant lost $1.08 a share. The company also provided two possib=le pro forma options: a 68 cents loss that excluded ``special charges,   in=cluding some acquisition costs and restructuring charges, and a still bette=r 27 cents loss that further excluded $1.9 billion of ``incremental charges=,   such as writing down inventories and increasing provisions for receivab=les. Wall Street chose the rosiest one.=20Confusing? You bet. Companies defend their pro forma calculations by pointi=ng out that they re merely filling a void: Investors are clamoring for a me=asure that gives them better insight into their company s future. The goal =is to get to the core of the business and try to measure the outlook for th=ose operations. ``There are good reasons why there is an emphasis on operat=ing earnings,   says Volcker. ``It is an effort to provide some continuity =and some reflection of the underlying progress of the company.   Besides, a=s companies like to point out, they still have to report GAAP earnings, and= investors are free to ignore everything else.=20There s no starker lesson in the shortcomings of GAAP than the $50 billion =asset write-downs by JDS Uniphase Corp., the biggest charge of the year. Ne=ar the height of the telecom bull market in July, 2000, the San Jose (Calif=.) maker of fiber optics topped off a buying spree by acquiring competitor =SDL Inc. for $41 billion in stock. When the deal closed in February, its as=sets ballooned from $25 billion to $65 billion. But by then, shares of JDS =and other fiber-optics makers were collapsing. To bring its acquisitions in=to line with their new value, the company took charges of $50 billion. Desp=ite the fact that the bulk of its losses stemmed from stock transactions an=d involved no cash paid, GAAP required that the charges be taken out of net= income. So according to GAAP, JDS lost $56 billion in the fiscal year endi=ng in June--a staggering figure for a company whose revenues over the past =five years added up to only $5 billion.=20Analysts and the company argue that besides not involving cash, the charge-=off was all about the past, a right-sizing of values that had gotten out of= hand. To analyze the company s prospects, they excluded the $50 billion ch=arge. ``The accounting is not designed to make things look better but to de=scribe what happened,   says JDS Uniphase Chief Financial Officer Anthony R=. Muller, ``and we ll live with the consequences, whatever they are.   Anal=ysts make a similar defense. ``My goal is to figure out what the business i=s going to produce so that we can value the company,   says Lehman Brothers= analyst Arnab Chanda. GLACIAL PACE. Are JDS s pro forma numbers realistic-=-a fair gauge of JDS s ongoing operations? Right now, it s hard for investo=rs to judge. And that s the kind of ambiguity S&P and others would like to =eliminate. In November, S&P circulated a memo on how to standardize operati=ng earnings. Under the proposal, operating earnings would include the costs= of purchases, research and development, restructuring costs (including sev=erance), write-downs from ongoing operations, and the cost to the company o=f stock options. It would exclude merger-and-acquisition expenses, impairme=nt of goodwill, litigation settlements, and the gain or loss on the sale of= an asset.=20When S&P applied roughly that formula to JDS Uniphase, it split the differe=nce between Wall Street and GAAP. Because of differences in what each group= included in their earnings calculations, the results were chaotic. Using G=AAP, the company lost $9.39 a share. S&P figures it lost $3.19, while the c=ompany put the loss at 36 cents. Meanwhile, Wall Street says it made 2 cent=s.=20The S&P standard may make sense, but it raises the question: Where is the F=inancial Accounting Standards Board, the group in charge of GAAP? Chairman =Edmund L. Jenkins says FASB will be addressing the problems. Still, investo=rs shouldn t expect any improvement soon. The pace of change at FASB tends =to be glacial. It typically takes four years to complete a new standard. In= 1996, for example, the board realized that standards on restructuring char=ges had some big loopholes and it resolved to put the issue on its agenda. =In June, 2000, the board finally issued a draft of a new standard, asked fo=r comments, and held a public hearing. In October, 2001, the board said it =still wasn t ready to put a fix in place. Now, the recession has set off an=other wave of restructuring charges, and the FASB still doesn t have new ru=les.=20The slow pace means the standard-setters sometimes fail to react to sudden =changes in the market. The most recent failure followed the terrorist attac=ks on September 11. An FASB task force, unable to come up with a set of rul=es for separating September 11 costs from general expenses, instead told co=mpanies that the disaster could not be treated as an extraordinary item. So= GAAP earnings include costs stemming from the disaster as part of a compan=y s general performance. Many companies have nevertheless broken those cost=s out in their unaudited press releases.=20Many more are likely to do so in the fourth quarter. Indeed, 2001 is shapin=g up to be one for the record books. A poor economy and the devastating aft=ereffects of September 11 have resulted in a slew of unusual charges that a=re unlikely to recur and that no one could have foreseen. But there s a gro=wing concern that the earnings fog is providing managers with cover to hide= missteps of the past within that vast category of supposedly one-time char=ges. The temptation will be to take as big a charge as possible now, while =investors are braced for bad news. Not only can managers sweep away yesterd=ay s errors, but tomorrow s earnings will look even better.=20The basic question comes down to what constitutes a special expense--a char=ge so unusual that to include it in the earnings calculation would be to di=stort the truth about a company s performance. Usually, big charges fall in=to a few categories, including charges for laying off workers and restructu=ring a company, charges for assets that have lost value since they were pur=chased, charges for investments that have lost value, and charges for inven=tory that has become obsolete. In a recent study, Harvard Business School p=rofessor Mark T. Bradshaw found that companies are increasingly calling the=se charges unusual. That gives them a rationale for excluding them from the=ir pro forma calculations.=20Lots of critics disagree, saying such charges are often an inevitable part =of the business cycle and should be reflected in a company s earnings histo=ry. They certainly should not be ignored by investors. ``Charges are real s=hareholder wealth that s been lost,   argues David W. Tice, manager of the =Prudent Bear Fund, a mutual fund with a pessimistic bent that s up 17% so f=ar this year. ``It s money they spent on something no longer worth what it =was, a correction of past earnings, or a reserve for costs moving forward. =Whatever the reason, it s a real cost to the company, and that hurts shareh=olders.   Without standards, excessive write-offs from operating earnings c=an obscure actual performance. Without any rules, companies calculate opera=ting earnings inconsistently in order to put their companies in the best po=ssible light. Dell Computer Corp. is a good example of this ``heads I win, =tails you lose   school of accounting. For years, Dell benefited from gains= in its venture-capital investments and was happy to include those gains in= its reported earnings, where they appeared as a separate line on the incom=e statement. But this year, when those gains turned to losses, the computer= maker issued pro forma numbers that excluded that $260 million drag. Dell =spokesman Michael Maher says the company s press releases and SEC filings b=reak out investment income and give GAAP numbers as well as pro forma. ``In= our view, the numbers are reported clearly,   says Maher. ``It s all out t=here for the consuming public.   PAST PUFFERY. Many experts believe special= charges are a sign that past performance was exaggerated. What should inve=stors make of a company such as Gateway Inc.? Two restructuring charges in =the first and third quarters, minus a small extraordinary gain, totaled $1.=12 billion, or about $100 million more than the company made in 1998, 1999,= and 2000 combined. Which is the truer picture of its performance and poten=tial? The write-offs or the earnings? Write-offs for customer financing are= another example. When Nortel increased its reserves for credit extended to= customers by $767 million in September, it effectively admitted it had boo=ked sales in the past to companies that couldn t pay--in effect overstating= its performance in those earlier periods. In addition, Nortel says booking= sales and accounting for credit are unrelated issues. Tech companies blame= the sharp downturn in their industry for the big write-offs. And these are=n t isolated examples. Peter L. Bernstein, publisher of newsletter Economic=s & Portfolio Strategy, found that from 1989 to 1993, 20% of earnings vanis=hed into write-offs.=20Big charge-offs can also distort future performance. Critics contend that e=xcess reserves are often used as a sort of ``cookie jar   from which earnin=gs can be taken in future quarters to meet Wall Street s expectations. Or c=harges taken this year, for example, which is apt to be a lousy one for mos=t companies anyway, might include costs that would otherwise have been take=n in future periods. Prepaying those costs gives a big boost to later earni=ngs. Rules for figuring operating earnings would help, but this is an area =that will always involve a certain amount of judgment--and therefore invite= a certain amount of abuse. ``People are going to write off everything they= can in the next two quarters because they re having a bad year anyway,   s=ays Robert G. Atkins, a Mercer Management consultant.=20Part of the lure of big special charges is that investors tend to shrug the=m off, believing that with the bad news out in the open, the company is poi=sed for a brighter future. Since Gateway detailed its third-quarter charge =of $571 million on Oct. 18, Wall Street has bid the stock up 48%, compared =with a 6% runup for the S&P 500.=20Often, though, investors should take exactly the opposite message. If, for =example, part of a restructuring involves slashing employee training, infor=mation-technology spending, or research and development, the cuts could dep=ress future performance, says Baruch Lev, a professor of accounting at the =Stern School of Business at New York University. ``Are these really one-tim=e events?   he asks. ``Or is this the beginning of an avalanche?   Indeed, =Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co. strategist Steve Galbraith has found that =in the year following a big charge-off to earnings companies have underperf=ormed the stock market by 20 percentage points. ``LA LA LAND.   Investors a=re apt to be faced with more huge write-offs next year, even if the economy= doesn t continue to worsen. Why? The transition to a new GAAP rule that ch=anges the way companies account for goodwill--a balance-sheet asset that re=flects the amount paid for an acquisition over the net value of the tangibl=e assets. Under the new rule, companies will have to assess their propertie=s periodically and decrease their worth on the balance sheet if their value= falls. An informal survey by Financial Executives International of its mem=ber controllers and financial officers found that at least a third expect t=o take more charges.=20But figuring out the proper value of those assets is no easy task. Unless t=here is a comparable company or factory with an established market price, v=aluing them involves a lot of guesswork for which there are no firm rules. =``What this is really coming down to is corporations and their auditors com=ing up with their own tests for impairment,   says the Stern School s Profe=ssor Paul R. Brown. ``It s La La Land.  =20While the tidal wave of special charges is providing cover for earnings gam=es, it could also be an impetus for change--especially in the wake of the d=ot-com fiasco. Indeed, there are some signs of a backlash. The real estate =investment trust industry was a pioneer of engineered earnings, with its ``=funds from operations,   or FFO. But now some REITs have begun to revert to= plain old GAAP earnings. Hamid R. Moghadam, CEO of San Francisco-based AMB= Property Corp., shifted back to GAAP in 1999. ``The reason I don t like FF=O is very simple,   says Moghadam. ``One company s numbers look better than= another one s even if they had identical fundamental results.  =20There are other steps FASB could take to improve financial reporting and re=store GAAP s status. Trevor S. Harris, an accounting expert at Morgan Stanl=ey, says it could force companies to make clear distinctions between income= from operations and income from financial transactions. Lehman s Willens s=ays companies should provide more information on cash expenses and how they= bear on earnings. An easy step would be to require companies to file their= press releases with the SEC.=20At the least, says Lev, companies must clearly explain how their pro forma =numbers relate to the GAAP numbers. Otherwise, he says, investors ``see num=bers floating there, and where did they come from?   In today s environment= of unregulated pro forma calculations and supersize write-offs, no questio=n is more important to investors.High-Gloss GlossaryCompanies are using a variety of accounting practices to put the best spin =ontheir results. Here s what those terms mean:DEFINING EARNINGS:NET INCOMEThe bottom line, according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAA=P).Sometimes called ``reported earnings,   these are the numbers the Securitie=s &Exchange Commission accepts in its filings.OPERATING EARNINGSAn adjustment of net income that excludes certain costs deemed to be unrela=tedto the ongoing business. Although it sounds deceptively like a GAAP figurecalled ``operating income   (revenue minus the costs of doing business), it= isnot an audited figure.CORE EARNINGSAnother term for operating earnings. Neither core nor operating earnings ar=ecalculated according to set rules. They can include or exclude anything thepreparer wishes.PRO FORMA EARNINGSThe 1990s term for operating earnings. Popularized by dot-coms, it sometime=sexcludes such basic costs as marketing and interest.EBITDAEarnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. Thegranddaddy of pro forma, it was initially highlighted by industries thatcarried high debt loads, such as cable TV, but has since come to be widelyquoted.ADJUSTED EARNINGSA new term for pro forma.DEFINING COSTS:SPECIAL CHARGESA general term for anything a company wants to highlight as unusual andtherefore to be excluded from future earnings projections.ASSET IMPAIRMENTSCharges taken to bring something a company paid a high price for down to it=scurrent market value. Many companies are now taking these charges on intern=alventure-capital funds that bought Internet and other high-tech stocks atinflated prices.GOODWILL IMPAIRMENTSThe same idea as asset impairments except they re used to write down thepremium a company paid over the fair market value of the net tangible asset=sacquired. These charges will explode in the first quarter of 2002 because o=f achange in mergers-and-acquisitions accounting that eliminates goodwillamortization and requires holdings to be carried at no more than fair value=s.RESTRUCTURING RESERVESAn accrued expense (not usually cash) to cover future costs of closing down= aportion of a business, a plant, or of firings. These are projected costs an=dif overstated can later become a boost to earnings as they are reversed.WRITE-DOWNLowering the value of an asset, such as a plant or stock investment. It isoften excused as a bookkeeping exercise, but there may have been a real cos=tlong ago that now proves ill spent, or there may have been associated cashcosts, such as investment-banking fees.Illustration: Chart: THE BIG BATH CHART BY ERIC HOFFMANN/BW=20Illustration: Chart: EARNINGS CHAOS CHART BY ERIC HOFFMANN/BW=20Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Or do you think it s just that people s per=ceptions about risk have changed?=20I ve been investing since 1959, and I have to say that, year after year, th=e risk hasn t changed. The risk is always there. There s risk in investing =in stocks, bonds and even U.S. Treasuries because of interest-rate [fluctua=tions]. There s risk in real estate, too.=20So the question is: How do you handle it? The best way is to diversify. Ove=r a long period of time, people who diversify their investments do pretty d=arned well. When they don t . . . sometimes it s fatal. If the only stock a=n investor owned was Enron . . . or Cisco at 70, that was pretty fatal.=20What do you say to people who say they re too scared to invest right now?

Last week a couple of heavy hitters left money on= the table.=20Mark McGwire, the home-run-hitting baseball player for St. Louis, retired. =And he let it be known that he never signed a two-year, $30 million contrac=t his agent negotiated last spring. Why? Because he wanted to find out if h=is injured right knee would allow him to play as well as he had before. It =didn t, and he decided he wasn t worth that kind of money.Then Ken Lay, chairman of Enron Corp., said he won t take the $60.6 million= he had coming to him in a severance agreement that comes into play when En=ron is sold to Dynegy Corp.=20Of course, neither McGwire nor Lay will ever have to consider my fallback r=etirement plan - sacking groceries at the supermarket, carrying them to the= car and hoping for a big tip. Still, it was a class act on both their part=s. McGwire only hit .187 last season, well below his lifetime average. And =Lay? Well, let s say that rarely in the history of American capitalism has =a company sunk as fast as Enron.=20Remember that earlier this year its stock hit a top of $82 a share. Now it =s hovering in the single-digit level, and Enron is being forced to sell its=elf to a smaller rival.=20The stock price incentive=20How did Enron get into this position? Put the blame on the company s relent=less drive to push up its stock price. And a big reason for that push comes= from the way American companies compensate top executives.=20In the last couple of decades, executive compensation has soared. The avera=ge chief executive officer today makes 531 times as much in salary, bonuses= and stock options as the average factory worker.=20Apologists for executive pay say these kinds of figures really aren t relev=ant. Most of the money top executives receive doesn t come from base pay or= bonuses but from stock options.=20Such options usually work this way. Executives are given hundreds or thousa=nds of shares of stock that they can only buy from the company at a future =date. The sales price can be anything from 10 cents to the price of the sto=ck on the date the options were granted. If the stock increases past the ex=ercise price in the option, the executive can buy the stock and then sell i=t, making big bucks. It the stock has dropped below the option price - it s= underwater, in the jargon - then those options are worthless.=20Granting options aligns the interests of the top executives with the shareh=olders, those who favor this sort of incentive say. And that s true, if you= talking about in-and-out traders. But it s not true if we re looking out f=or the interests of the majority who hold stocks for the long term.=20Keeping the debt hidden=20Keeping its stock price soaring was what brought down Enron.=20To hype the stock, Enron s execs were hiding the debt it took on to fuel it=s amazing growth and some of its dicier investments, in partnerships. Enron= was supposedly only a minority partner in these deals. That way it could m=ove a large portion of its debt off its books in that partnership. That, in= turn, made the company s earnings look better.=20When Enron s executives finally fessed up, they had to write down their pro=fits over the past few years by 20 percent. But the real irony here is that= 80 percent is still a heck of a lot of money. But by that time, the majori=ty of shareholders simply had no faith in Enron s bookkeeping.=20Now look at Lay s compensation. In 1999 he exercised stock options and made= $44 million on them. In 2000, sales of options brought him $123 million, a=nd this year about $26 million, according to a study published by Bloomberg= News.=20Was Lay deliberating deceiving investors to keep his stock options profitab=le? I don t think so. He was simply following the latest fad in corporate g=overnance. He was aligning himself with the interests of the shareholders.==20The shareholders were happy with that high stock price. Nobody - besides so=me stock analysts - complained about Enron s often- impenetrable bookkeepin=g until that stock price started to fall.=20Would Enron s bookkeeping have been different if top executives received fe=wer stock options? Maybe.=20Fewer stock options would mean lower pay for the top guys. And no one would= want that job if he were only going to make $10 million a year instead of =$100 million.=20Just kidding.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

ROSEN11/18/2001The New York TimesPage 8, Column 2c. 2001 New York Times CompanyDESPITE last week s plunge in the price of crude oil and in shares of big o=il companies, some Wall Street analysts remain upbeat about the long-term p=rospects for energy stocks.=20  These very dramatic downturns are great buying opportunities,   said Tina= Vital, an oil and gas analyst at Standard & Poor s, who recommends a broad= group of integrated oil companies, including Exxon Mobil, ChevronTexaco, R=oyal Dutch/Shell, BP and TotalFinaElf.   They have excellent management, a =top dividend yield and are a safe haven for investors,   she said, provided= that investors are patient and can bear short-term swings.Last week s price declines were set off by Russian oil companies  refusal t=o accept demands by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries f=or big production cuts. They were a reminder that the sector is extremely v=olatile.   Oil could go to $10 a barrel short term,   she said, but there i=s no certainty of that. The oil producers could reach an agreement by Janua=ry, sending prices upward. Over the long term, she expects to see productio=n cuts.=20Demand for energy has grown only 0.5 percent this year, and prices have bee=n declining for some time for both crude oil and gasoline -- as drivers hav=e seen at the gas pump. West Texas intermediate crude closed Friday at $18.=03 on the New York Mercantile Exchange, up 58 cents from its Thursday close=, the lowest since June 1999. But an economic recovery, expected by late 20=02, could cause demand to pick up, analysts say.=20As oil prices have dropped, so have the prices of most oil stocks, but not =as much as the overall market since the beginning of 2000. Over that period=, the S.& P. energy index has lost 8 percent, while the S.& P. 500-stock in=dex is down 23 percent.=20A report issued last week by the Energy Department said that while the Sept=. 11 terrorist attacks had intensified the country s economic slowdown,   t=hey are not expected to result in any long-term volatility in energy market=s.   The report estimated that commercial energy demand would rise 1.7 perc=ent a year through 2020, instead of the 1.2 percent predicted only a year a=go. Its predictions assume increased use of computers and office equipment,= and slower increases in fuel efficiency for cars and trucks.=20WHILE they warn of the possibility of wild price shifts in the months ahead=, other analysts are similarly bullish for the long term. L. Bruce Lanni, s=enior oil analyst at A. G. Edwards & Sons in New York, said that any potent=ial price war was likely to be fairly short-lived, because neither OPEC nor= non-OPEC countries could   withstand low oil prices for a prolonged period= of time,   and prices should rebound sharply as a result,   back up in the= lower to mid-$20 range.  =20Low prices could be painful for most of the oil companies in the short term=, but Mr. Lanni, too, sees value in the stocks.=20His top pick is Conoco, now trading at $24.30; his 12-month target is $34. =  We remain confident,   he said,   that the company s annual oil and gas p=roduction should grow by about 4 percent, on average, over the next several= years.  =20Conoco s debt, at 55 percent of capital, is relatively high, but he expects= the company s strong cash flow -- it equaled $5.33 a share last year -- to= reduce the debt level to 46 percent next year and to 38 percent in 2003. T=he company s after-tax interest cost is only 3.5 percent, he said.=20Mr. Lanni also favors Kerr-McGee, a natural gas exploration and production =company, and BP, calling both undervalued. He regards Exxon Mobil, Royal Du=tch/Shell and ChevronTexaco as fully priced, so he is not recommending buyi=ng them now.   If you own them, hold them,   he said.=20William Featherston, executive director and an oil and gas exploration anal=yst at UBS Warburg, said he felt   near-term caution but medium-term optimi=sm for sustainably higher   natural gas prices. He said he would encourage =investors to consider buying shares of exploration and production companies= over the next two months. His top picks are Apache, Kerr-McGee and EOG Res=ources.=20Such stocks are highly volatile, he said. They are   trading-oriented vehic=les, and short-term volatility in commodity prices generally provides the m=ost attractive entry and exit points,   he said.   While natural gas prices= declined throughout most of this year, prices rose at a startling pace, fr=om $1.75 per million cubic feet at the end of September to over $3 per mill=ion cubic feet within weeks.  =20He cited three reasons for the price rally: a decline in gas surpluses, pre=dictions of a colder-than-normal winter and what he has called   pathetic t=hird-quarter natural gas production,   despite record drilling activity.=20The tangled finances of the Enron Corporation were also a factor in the rec=ent price increase for natural gas futures, he said. Enron, which marketed =25 billion cubic feet a day of natural gas, or more than 40 percent of the =nation s demand, is under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Comm=ission and announced a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity from de=als with partnerships involving its former chief financial officer. It also= reported a third-quarter loss and restated earlier earnings. Enron has agr=eed to be taken over by Dynegy, a smaller rival, for about $9 billion in st=ock. Dynegy is also assuming about $13 billion in debt.=20Anxiety over whether the Enron investigation would disrupt deliveries or ha=ve other market repercussions led to an increase in prices. While it is   d=ifficult to quantify the Enron factor,   Mr. Featherston said, the short-te=rm effects on natural gas prices seem to be over.=20OTHER factors, of course, could also mean a bumpy ride for energy investors= over the next several months. The status of the war against terrorism, Pre=sident Bush s decision to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, thus helpin=g OPEC in reducing excess global capacity, and a United Nations review of t=he food-for-oil deal with Iraq expected in December could each have a signi=ficant impact on battered oil prices.=20Nevertheless, Ms. Vital said, for the long term, energy will probably be in= short supply, and new sources must be developed. So she also likes the pro=spects of two drilling companies, Noble Drilling and Nabors Industries. Bot=h took a beating last week, along with the oil companies, so again she sees= buying opportunities.=20Bern Fleming, portfolio manager of the AXP Utilities Income fund in Minneap=olis, who has stakes in Dynegy, Duke Energy and Dominion Resources, said al=l three had good prospects for growth, thanks to a mix of assets,   managem=ent I respect and solid business plans.

Aquila said it began making contingency plans in case Dynegywithdrew from its $24 billion takeover of Enron, the paperreported.     Enron, the largest energy trader, decided to sell after itsshares plunged this year and a federal investigation of accountingirregularities limited its ability to finance operations. Enron scollapse would have caused upheaval in energy markets, where thecompany does one-quarter of all gas and power trades.     Dynegy s agreement to buy Enron allows it to withdraw fromthe transaction under certain circumstances, the FT said.PERSPECTIVESA tale of greed and hubrisWaldo Proffitt11/18/2001Sarasota Herald-TribuneAllF2(Copyright 2001)For anyone not already disenchanted with the idea of total deregulation of =public utilities, the most recent installment of the miserable Enron story =as it unfolded last week should serve as a convincing example of the folly =of relying on unregulated profit- driven enterprises to supply our energy.==20A year ago Enron was the darling of Wall Street, the poster boy for the uti=lity industry, its stock selling for about $85 a share. Last week its stock= was worth about 10 percent of that and the company had agreed to be bought= by a competitor. There was fear the company s bond rating might fall to th=e ""junk"" level.What happened? It will take months, if not years, to untangle the details, =but it is clear that the main culprit was greed, closely followed by hubris=.=20Not too many years ago Enron was a small, struggling, gas pipeline company =in Houston. As deregulation spread to more and more states, Enron began acq=uiring pipelines, gas producers and utilities.=20It also acquired friends in high places, especially the Bush family and the=ir key political advisers. And, it discovered it could make money faster by= selling and trading energy than by producing it. Enron sold many of its ge=nerating plants and became the biggest ""power broker"" in the nation.=20Though it was by no means the largest winner in the con game that bilked Ca=lifornia consumers of tens of billions of dollars, Enron was one of the fir=st power barons to take advantage of California s flawed deregulation law -=- virtually written by in-state and out-of- state utility companies.=20The California fiasco soured (probably) most Americans on utility deregulat=ion, but Enron was not singled out for calumny, and management saw no reaso=n to examine its business ethics.=20Contrarywise. management had visions of even greater profits, which it felt= no obligation to share with ordinary stockholders. The chief financial off=icer and other high-ranking executives set up affiliated or subsidiary part=nerships which made deals with Enron. I do not understand the details of th=ese arrangements, but neither do independent accountants, the Securities an=d Exchange Commission or congressional investigators. It does seem clear th=at the Enron insiders made millions for themselves.=20Enron acknowledges, without explaining, that stockholder equity dropped $1.=2 billion in the last quarter and that it had for the last five years overs=tated profits by some $600 million. Whether this was by design or by mistak=e is in dispute, but it is the sort of thing which tends to undermine the c=onfidence of investors.=20So much for greed. Back to hubris. It seems not unlikely that Enron s leade=rs felt they might not be punished for a modest amount of corner-cutting be=cause they had friends in high places.=20The chief executive, Kenneth L. Lay, was and is a personal friend of George= W. Bush and has easy access to the White House. For many months after the =new administration took office, Karl Rove, Bush s top political strategist,= owned Enron stock valued at $100,000 to $250,000, and sold it only after h=e had been able to secure a ruling that he did not have to pay capital gain=s tax immediately because he sold to avoid a conflict of interest. Lawrence= Lindsey, the president s chief economic coordinator, and I. Lewis Libby, V=ice President Cheney s chief of staff, owned stock in Enron, and Lindsey wa=s paid $50,000 last year as a consultant for Enron.=20Enron and its employees gave more than anyone else to Bush s four political= campaigns -- one (unsuccessful) for Congress, two for governor and one for= president. In 2000, Enron and its employees gave $113,000 to Bush s campai=gn, $250,000 to the Republican National Committee, and $300,000 to the Pres=idential Inauguration Committee.=20Cabinet appointments affecting energy policy, key sub-Cabinet appointments,= administration action or inaction in the California energy mess, and the o=verall energy policy of the administration could hardly have been more favo=rable to the interests of Enron.=20And now a couple of questions: Is it possible the unusual financial maneuve=rs by Enron went unnoticed or even unsuspected by all the savvy Texas oilme=n in the Bush administration? Were those of them with heavy investments in =Enron unconcerned about the conduct of the company? Was Enron right in thin=king its friends in government would not be in a hurry to investigate or to= reprimand?=20Or, in light of our preoccupation with terrorism, will the Enron case get m=uch attention from the federal government? Or from voters?=20Waldo Proffitt is the former editor of the Herald-Tribune.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Even so, stocks will have to post strong gains in the next six weeks =to keep this from being the market s worst calendar year since 1977.=20The blue-chip Standard & Poor s 500 index rose 1.6% last week, but it s sti=ll down 13.8% year to date.=20Yet those losses, while certainly not trivial (especially when they re your=s), can obscure what arguably are some very positive aspects of this year s= experiences.=20With investing, adversity can be a more important teacher than success. If =you re having trouble this Thanksgiving week finding reasons to be thankful= about anything investment-related, try these on for size:=20* ""Asset allocation"" is no longer just a quaint theory. The paramount inves=ting rule has always been to spread your money around to reduce risk. But i=t took the worst stock bear market in 25 years to bring this lesson home fo=r many people who thought equities only rose in value.=20Now, millions of investors have a far better appreciation for just how much= they can lose in stocks--and how bonds and short-term cash savings can off=set market losses and preserve capital.=20It has been a hard lesson, to be sure. But investors who take asset allocat=ion to heart will be laying a much more solid foundation for their money in= the long run. And don t underestimate what that can mean for your peace of= mind long term.=20* The wisdom of saving money on a regular basis has been relearned. In the =late 1990s, many economists lamented how the U.S. savings rate continued to= shrink. Some people felt there was little need to put significant new sums= into savings when the stocks or stock mutual funds they owned seemed to be= rising nonstop.=20In other words, many Americans were letting the stock market do their savin=g for them when share prices were rising 20% or more each year.=20Now, with shares down and with the likelihood of much more moderate returns= on stocks in this decade, it s clear that many people will have to find a =way to save regularly if they re going to meet their long-term financial go=als, especially retirement.=20This may not be a pleasant reality, but it s better for most people to have= faced this fact sooner rather than later, while there may be time to make =up lost ground.=20* A healthy skepticism has replaced mindless euphoria about stocks and thos=e who tout them. The market s slide has discredited a legion of Wall Street= analysts, money managers and others whose knowledge, understanding and jud=gment were clearly lacking, in retrospect.=20Investors have come to see that having blind faith in those who present the=mselves as ""experts"" is a highly dangerous strategy, if it can be called a =strategy at all.=20Sure, it may have been more fun when technology stocks were shooting the mo=on and nobody had much use for reviewing a company s fundamentals. But that= wasn t investing--it was speculating, and on a massive, and ultimately rui=nous, scale.=20People have learned to be less trusting about what others say about the mar=ket, and that is more likely to be beneficial than detrimental to their por=tfolios in the long run.=20Just ask anyone who shifted their entire 401(k) retirement savings sum into= aggressive-growth mutual funds in the first quarter of 2000--right before =the market peaked--because of the bullish comments of some 25-year-old tech= stock analyst. Those investors aren t likely to make a move like that agai=n.=20* Free-market forces are weeding out the weak players and the phonies. Capi=talism may be harsh, but it s efficient when the good times end and it s ti=me to find out which companies truly have talent and staying power--and des=erve more capital.=20Hundreds of dot-coms have failed, but who really misses them? Is it any har=der to find what you want on the Internet? It probably would have been much= worse for all concerned if those companies had sucked up investors  funds =for another year instead of failing when they did.=20But the market isn t just eliminating small companies that never had much o=f a future. The financial near-collapse of energy giant Enron Corp. exposed= a business that twisted accounting rules to its own benefit--to the point =that the company now concedes that financial statements all the way back to= 1997 ""should not be relied upon.""=20Also to be weeded out, though over a longer time period, will be mutual fun=d managers whose performance running other peoples  money has been a nightm=are for those investors--meaning, the returns produced have been far worse =than what the investors would have achieved in the average fund in that par=ticular sector.=20These managers know who they are--and, hopefully, their shareholders know b=y now as well, and will vote with their feet.=20The free market also is reminding cartels just how tough it is to control p=rices.=20Once again, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has lost its =ability to prop up crude oil prices, which have sunk to two-year lows amid =the weak global economy. That s lousy for OPEC, but it s great for every en=ergy consumer.=20* The market s woes have altered many investors  priorities for the better.= The wild bull market of the late 1990s demanded peoples  attention, and go=t it.=20For some, stocks became an obsession. Their portfolios dominated their live=s, especially if they were actively trading shares. They believed they were= going to be rich, or richer, and that it was all because of how smart they= were.=20Now, most people have been humbled by the market. In the process, some have= realized that they don t want their mood determined by their portfolio s d=ay-to-date price changes.=20The Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, of course, also changed many peoples  view =of what truly matters to them.=20Money is important, but you aren t your stocks, and they aren t you.

GlassmanDon t Be A Pudd n head, DiversifyJames K. Glassman11/18/2001The Washington PostFINALH01Copyright 2001, The Washington Post Co. All Rights ReservedWarren Buffett, who was probably the greatest investor of the 20th century,= is fond of quoting the salacious actress Mae West as saying, ""Too much of =a good thing can be wonderful."" In the market, such a motto would lead you =to avoid diversification and instead concentrate your portfolio in stocks y=ou really, really like.=20Peter Lynch, who was probably the best mutual fund manager of the 20th cent=ury, calls spreading yourself too thin ""diworseification.""Smart, witty and brilliant at picking stocks, Buffett and Lynch may not nee=d diversification, but the rest of us do. When you own one stock, you re ou=t on a limb. For example, very few analysts -- with or without a conflict o=f interest -- predicted that shares of Enron, the energy and trading compan=y, would tumble by 90 percent in a year. Put all your eggs in a basket like= that and you end up with a gooey mess. The more stocks you own -- as long =as they are in different industries -- the more the overall riskiness of yo=ur portfolio is modulated.=20The reason you don t want a super-risky portfolio is simple: While Warren B=uffett may be calm and prescient enough to ride out severe dips in the valu=e of his holdings, most investors are not. A portfolio that increases in pr=ice by 10 percent each and every year is worth exactly the same at the end =of three years as a portfolio that falls by half the first year, rises by t=hree-quarters the second and rises by 52 percent the third. But reasonable =investors prefer the consistent ride. It prevents them from doing something= stupid, such as selling all their stocks after losing half their money dur=ing that first disastrous year.=20Consider the sad case of James D. McCall, who earlier this month resigned a=s manager of the Merrill Lynch Focus Twenty mutual fund. Two years ago, Mer=rill wanted McCall s services so desperately that the firm went to court to= pry McCall away from his previous employer, Pilgrim Baxter, where he rang =up impressive gains in the late 1990s. (His big success was called PBHG Lar=ge Cap 20.) And when they got McCall, Merrill s brokers raised more than $1=.5 billion from their clients for him to invest. While the average growth-s=tock mutual fund owns about 100 stocks, with the top 10 holdings representi=ng about one-fourth of the portfolio s total value, McCall specialized in w=hat are called ""concentrated portfolios."" In the case of Merrill Lynch Focu=s Twenty, he owned, as the name implies, just 20 stocks. At last report, hi=s top 10 holdings accounted for a whopping two-thirds of the fund s assets.==20If McCall had spread his 20 stocks among, say, a dozen different industries=, he might have smoothed his ride. Instead, 69 percent of his assets went t=o technology firms. The Focus fund and a smaller one that McCall ran called= Premier Growth were launched in March 2000. Within just 17 months, all but= $650 million of the clients  original $1.5 billion had vanished.=20It is hard to imagine losing as much as Focus Twenty did even if you tried.= As of Nov. 9, the week McCall resigned, the fund was down 72 percent for t=he year, compared with a loss of 14 percent for the Standard & Poor s 500-s=tock index, the benchmark for fund managers. According to the latest report= from Morningstar Mutual Funds, 19 of McCall s 20 stocks had declined durin=g 2001, the only exception being Harley-Davidson. More amazing, 16 of the 1=9 losers had fallen by at least half. (By the way, Enron was McCall s seven=th-largest holding.)=20""This fund has had a wretched existence,"" wrote Morningstar analyst Kunal K=apoor, who did admit a grudging admiration for McCall s perseverance. McCal=l s ""faith may turn out to be well placed over time,"" Kapoor said. Unfortun=ately, time ran out.=20My point here is not to pick on McCall but to reveal the perils of concentr=ation. Buying Focus Twenty as a technology fund, and consigning it to no mo=re than one-fifth of your holdings (with the rest of your assets in diversi=fied, conventional stocks or funds) might have made sense, but Focus Twenty= was touted as a ""long-term capital appreciation"" fund, not a sector fund. =Here, it failed, but maybe it didn t have to.=20The manager who made the concentrated fund popular, Tom Marsico, who ran Ja=nus Twenty, took care to spread his holdings around. His successor, Scott S=choelzel, has suffered losses lately (he is down 28 percent year-to-date, b=ut that s after a total gain of 546 percent in the preceding five years), b=ut they have not been nearly so catastrophic -- and for good reason. Schoel=zel s last report lists among his top 10 holdings three tech stocks, two fi=nancials, one drug company, one energy firm (whoops, Enron again), one indu=strial, one consumer-durables company and one services firm.=20For investors in individual stocks, the important question is this: How muc=h diversification is enough? Some risk is inherent in even the broadest por=tfolio. This is called market, or ""systematic,"" risk. Over the past 75 year=s, market risk, as measured in standard deviation, has been about 20 percen=t. In other words, in two-thirds of the years the annual return of the S&P =has fallen into a band ranging from 20 points lower to 20 points higher tha=n its average return of 11 percent; that is, between a loss of 9 percent an=d a gain of 31 percent. That s still volatile, but if you invest in stocks =you have to live with it.=20What you don t have to live with is anything more volatile. So your objecti=ve in building a portfolio is to try to approximate systematic risk and avo=id what is called ""idiosyncratic,"" or extra, risk. A portfolio with just a =few stocks, or one like McCall s, that is overloaded in a single sector, ha=s lots of idiosyncratic risk. In 1977, an influential study found that inve=stors could nearly eliminate that extra risk by owning just 20 stocks in a =wide variety of sectors; in fact, owning eight or 10 stocks depressed risk =sharply.=20Recently, however, the market has appeared to be far more volatile, and a n=ew study by a group of economists headed by John Campbell of Harvard found =that many more stocks were needed -- around 50 -- to bring a portfolio down= to the same level of riskiness as the broad market. What Campbell s group =found was that neither the market itself nor individual sectors had become =more volatile in the 1990s, but that stocks within those sectors had, so yo=u need to own more of them.=20But owning 50 stocks is a pain in the neck -- and it brings up the Buffett-=Lynch admonitions about too much diversification. It is hard just to take t=he time to make the selections, but even buy-and-hold investors need to kee=p track of the companies they own to spot adverse changes in management, pr=oduct failures or new competition (not to mention Enron-style accounting sh=enanigans) -- signs that it s time to sell.=20One good answer is to achieve balance by owning a combination of mutual fun=ds and stocks. For example, you might want to put 50 percent of the money y=ou have allotted for stocks into a fund that mimics the S&P itself, like Va=nguard Index 500, which charges rock-bottom expenses and guarantees that ri=sk won t exceed systematic levels. You could also consider a broad fund tha=t s managed by human beings, such as Meridian Value or Baron Growth, which =are recommended by Sheldon Jacobs, editor of the No-Load Fund Investor news=letter. Then another 25 percent of your holdings can go into a few sector f=unds that specialize in technology, real estate, energy and small-caps, and= the final 25 percent into a portfolio of 10 to 20 individual stocks. (I ow=n 16, at last count.)=20There are many valid variations. Just don t emulate Mark Twain.=20In a letter to clients recently, Anthony M. Maramarco of David L. Babson & =Co., the Cambridge, Mass., investment firm, recalled the aphorism of Twain =s Pudd n head Wilson: ""Put all your eggs in the one basket -- and watch tha=t basket!"" Unfortunately, such a philosophy emphatically does not work in s=tock investing -- as Twain himself learned when he sank nearly all his fort=une into the Paige Linotype, a machine that flopped.=20We all make mistakes. (It was Twain, after all, who pointed out that ""human= beings are the only animals that blush -- or need to."") But smart diversif=ication helps investors avoid some of the worst of them.=20James K.

This came after Enron officers made more than $1=36 million selling stocks earlier in the year.=20Then on Nov. 8, Enron dropped the other shoe: It admitted it had overstated= earnings for four years by $586 million, or 20 percent.

All Rights ReservedFINANCE WEEK - From dealing to reeling - The legacy of the late 1990s stock= market bubble remains with us, as does irrationality THE LONG VIEW - BARRY= RILEY.=20Optimism is back. Stock markets around the globe have typically rallied by =20 per cent since rock bottom was reached on September 21. Only 9 per cent =of global fund managers believe equities will be lower in 12 months, accord=ing to a Merrill Lynch survey published this week.But the legacy of the late 1990s stock market bubble remains with us. The c=hallenge is how to minimise the level of irrationality. Two of the UK s big=gest losers from crazy prices reported on Tuesday. Vodafone suffered #11.45=bn of write-downs - but curiously, made no provisions against the sky-high =#13.1bn it paid for third-generation mobile phone licences in 2000.=20Such payments, argued Sir Christopher Gent, Voda-fone s chief executive, we=re merely what the market demanded at the time. It is interesting to note, =too, that Paul Klemperer, the Oxford professor who is an expert in ""auction= theory"" and advised the British government, has defended the disastrous ou=tcome by arguing that the prices reflected the capital market s view of 3G =s prospects. The common theme here is that it is nobody s fault if crazy pr=ices are paid, because they are legitimised by the stock market.=20Marconi, which is financially in a much worse state than the mobile phone g=iant, has written off most of the #4.1bn paid for US internet hardware comp=anies in 1999. There has also been a great deal of controversy in the US du=ring the past few weeks over the near-collapse of Enron, the power group be=ing rescued by a takeover bid from its smaller rival Dynegy. There was an o=bvious failure by investors - and by stock market analysts - to assess the =true risks at Enron.=20Smart businessmen will sellat mad prices, but why on earth should they buy?= The trouble is, too many academics have developed theories of value based =on rational expectations. The real world is unfortunately very different.==20Some of the distortions had obvious technical origins. The Vodafone bubble =of 1999 reflected the cross-border takeover of Mannesmann and the artificia=l weighting shortages that developed from that transaction as Vodafone ball=ooned in market capitalisation to reach, at one stage, 16 per cent of the F=TSE 100 Index. The market price was driven not by normal corporate fundamen=tals, but by the desire of most fund managers to reach a market weighting, =at which point they were ""safe"" in terms of risk against the index benchmar=k.=20That was the period when investment banks exploited the idea of low free-fl=oat new issues: internet companies, especially, were floated off with only =15 per cent of the stock made available, although anything up to 100 per ce=nt went into the indices, creating serious shortages and bubble valuations.= Changes now being made to the main stock market indices have reduced the p=roblem, but there remains a basic irrationality in the concept that investm=ent risk resides in an index rather than in the underlying stocks.=20Takeovers have always been plagued by irrationality, and indeed this is an =area where academics recognise the problem; over many years they have point=ed out that all the benefits of deals, and often more than all, accrue to t=he shareholders of the companies taken over, while investors in the bidding= companies suffer dilution. Investors know this, and in normal market condi=tions news of a takeover will depress the bidder s share price. But in a bu=bble market these prudent attitudes can be overwhelmed by euphoria, as well= as technical factors relating to demand by fund managers so that they can =maintain their weightings when a bidder is spraying around large quantities= of new equity.=20Also, it is irrational that many more deals are done when the stock market =is high than when it is low. Two years ago, companies such as Marconi were =engaged in buying sprees at daft prices. Now, when prices are much lower, h=ardly any acquisitions are being made (and investment banks are dismissing =thousands of employees). An exception to the deal famine is gold mining, wh=ich just happens to have been one of the stock market s strongest sectors t=his year.=20Another important source of irrationality has been the domination of stock =market analysis by the stockbroking offshoots of the investment banks. Over= recent years their earnings-per-share forecasts for the next calendar year= have been on average 8 per cent too high. This has not just been a mistake=; they have been paid to be over-optimistic. Admittedly, attempts are being= made to restructure the incentives here, as the embarrassed investment ban=ks come under pressure from the regulators and the courts for their errors =of judgment during the bull market, but it remains to be seen whether much =will really change.=20The mystery is why anybody would take notice of these forecasts, and indeed= many professional investors do not.

Enron, which has been criticized for failing to clearlyexplain how it makes money, may disclose in Monday s filing moreon how much is owed by the company and affiliated partnerships, aswell as any planned job cuts and other cost-saving moves relatedto Dynegy s $24 billion buyout.     ``Investors will be looking for anything that affects thelikelihood of the (Dynegy) deal going through and the timing ofsuch a deal,   said Edward Paik, who helps manage the LibertyUtilities Fund, which owns 1.6 million in Enron shares.     Enron agreed to sell after its stock plunged 67 percent inthree weeks amid an SEC investigation into partnerships run byEnron executives. Investors worry that new disclosures, such aspreviously unreported debt, might threaten Enron s credit ratingand scuttle the merger, possibly pushing Enron into bankruptcy.     ``There s been so much skepticism about what Enron sliabilities are with these partnerships, I m looking to quantifythis,   said Glen Hilton, a fund manager at Montgomery AssetManagement LP, which holds Dynegy shares.     Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay admitted last week that failedinvestments and a loss of investor confidence forced the sale toDynegy, and he and other executives pledged to be more open withinvestors. Lay, 59, said last week he won t accept a severancepackage of more than $60 million that he could have collectedfollowing the takeover.     Enron shares fell 48 cents yesterday to $9. Dynegy fell$1.53, or 3.5 percent, to $42.47.                           Balance Sheet     Enron s third-quarter report, which had been expected lastweek, was delayed by the Dynegy talks and a restatement ofearnings, Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey McMahon said. Enronreduced net income for four years by a combined $586 million toinclude losses from affiliated partnerships.     Monday s filing, called a 10-Q, will include a balance sheetsummarizing assets and debts. Enron for years has omitted balancesheets, which the SEC requires as part of the 10-Q, from its pressreleases announcing earnings.     Investors renewed their criticisms of the practice after Laymentioned during a conference call last month that dealings withtwo partnerships had reduced Enron s shareholder equity, or itsassets minus liabilities, by $1.2 billion. The disclosure led tothe ouster of Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow.     ``Everyone is trying to make their own assessment of what(Enron s) ultimate liability will need to be,   said CommerzbankSecurities analyst Andre Meade, who rates the shares ``hold   anddoesn t own them.     Monday s report probably won t give a complete answer, saidLouis Gagliardi, an analyst at John S. Herold Inc. While thebalance sheet will list liabilities for the partnerships, whichwere set up to buy Enron assets and get debt off the company sbooks, it won t spell out Enron s share, he said.     ``What is the net liability off the balance sheet?  Gagliardi said. ``We really don t know what that number is.                             Credit Rating     Dynegy has said it can back out of the acquisition if Enron slegal liabilities exceed $3.5 billion. The balance sheet ``willhelp us see how good a deal this is for Dynegy,   said KathleenVuchetich, co-manager of the $1.4 billion Strong AmericanUtilities Fund, which owns 284,000 Dynegy shares.     Both companies are based in Houston.     The filing also might offer details on the SEC probe. ``Itmay say what the SEC is looking for, and what the rating agencieshave told them,   said Christopher Ellinghaus, an analyst atWilliams Capital Group. He added, though, ``I don t expect much.       Enron s stock drop led Moody s Investors Service to cut thecompany s debt rating to the lowest investment grade. Dynegy heldoff on a purchase agreement out of concern that the rating wouldbe cut to junk, jeopardizing Enron s ability to raise cash neededto settle its daily power and natural-gas trades.     Enron may reveal where it expects to cut jobs and how much itwill pay to departing employees, Paik said. Chief OperatingOfficer Greg Whalley said last week that fourth-quarter profitwill be hurt by severance payments and reorganization costs. Hedidn t give details.     Jobs likely will be eliminated in businesses the companyplans to sell, including its money-losing telecommunications unitand operations i"

Marilyn Monroe wore a size 14.[IMAGE]If Barbie was a real woman, she d have to walk on all fours due to  her proportions. The average woman weighs 144 lb. and wears between a  12-14. One out of every four college aged women has an eating!  disorder.[IMAGE]The models in the  magazines are airbrushed -- not perfect! A psychological study in 1995  found that three minutes spent looking at a fashion magazine caused 70% of  women to feel depressed, guilty, and shameful.   Models  twenty years ago weighed 8% less than the average woman.[IMAGE]Today they weigh 23%  less.[IMAGE]~Beauty of a Woman~  The beauty  of a woman is not in the clothes she wears, The  figure she carries, or the way she combs her hair. The  beauty of a woman must be seen from her eyes, Because that  is the doorway to her heart, The place where love resides.  The beauty of a woman Is not in a facial mole,  But true beauty in a woman is reflected in her soul.  It is the caring that she lovingly gives,  The passion that she shows. The beauty  of a woman With passing years -- only  grows.[IMAGE]An English professor  wrote the words, ""Woman without her man is nothing,"" on the blackboard and  directed the students to punctuate it correctly. The men wrote: ""Woman,  without her man, is nothing."" The women wrote: ""Woman! Without her, man is  nothing."" The Images of Mother 4 YEARS OF AGE ~ My Mommy can  do anything! 8 YEARS OF AGE ~ My Mom knows a lot! A whole  lot![IMAGE]12 YEARS OF AGE ~ My  Mother doesn t really know quite everything. 14 YEARS  OF AGE ~ Naturally, Mother doesn t know that, either. 16  YEARS OF AGE ~ Mother? She s hopelessly old-fashioned. 18  YEARS OF AGE ~ That old woman? She s way out of date! 25  YEARS OF AGE ~ Well, she might know a little bit about it.  35 YEARS OF AGE ~ Before we decide, let s get Mom s opinion.  45 YEARS OF AGE ~ Wonder what Mom would have thought about  it? 65 YEARS OF AGE ~ Wish I could talk it over with Mom.  ***Please send this to at least  five phenomenal women today in celebration of Women s History Month.

It is a sign that investors are willing to pay a rich price f=or option protection and expect the stock to be unsettled as the Houston co=mpany sorts through its credit and debt problems and seeks to calm frazzled= investors.=20Enron near-month defensive puts traded heavily in an otherwise quiet sessio=n Wednesday, as investors bought them to hedge. The December 5 puts traded =more than 10,000 contracts and jumped 45 cents to $1.10 at the Chicago Boar=d Options Exchange. The stock closed down $1.98, or 28%, to $5.01, as of 4 =p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.Enron s calls traded actively as some investors sold them to generate incom=e. Traders noted some call buying -- especially after Enron procured a thre=e-week extension on a $690 million note -- as some hopeful investors bet on= Enron pulling through its troubles and proceeding with its merger with Dyn=egy Inc. Enron s December 5 calls traded more than 14,500 contracts, compar=ed with open interest of 710, as they fell $1.45 to $1.15 at the CBOE.=20For investors who want to book a tax loss on beaten-down stocks, the ""wash =sale"" rule can be a hurdle, because it essentially prevents taxpayers from =selling stock or securities at a loss and then reacquiring ""substantially i=dentical"" securities within a 30-day period before or after that loss. This= poses a problem for those who want to book a loss yet own stocks whose pri=ces now make them attractive ""buy"" candidates.=20In addition, the Internal Revenue Service has taken the position that the w=ash-sale rule will disallow a loss if the investor sells an in-the-money pu=t, because there is a strong likelihood that stock will be put to or acquir=ed by the investor.=20So investors typically get around the wash-sale rule by ""doubling up"": buyi=ng additional stock or options, waiting at least 31 days, and then selling =the original stock to book the loss. Investors double up by buying calls, w=hich locks a price to buy stock and achieves the same effect as buying addi=tional stock.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. =09Dynegy Deal To Buy Enron Hits CrossroadsBy Rebecca Smith and John R. EmshwillerStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal11/23/2001The Wall Street JournalA3(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)Even as it reiterated its intention to purchase Enron Corp., Dynegy Inc. is= coming under increasing pressure to renegotiate or walk away from the mult=ibillion-dollar deal.=20The pressure is stemming from the continuing slide in the price of Enron sh=ares and the mounting financial problems at the Houston energy-trading comp=any, the nation s biggest marketer of electricity and natural gas. During t=he past month, Enron has taken a $1 billion write-off of assets, revised do=wnward the earnings of the past several years and taken a $1.2 billion redu=ction in shareholder equity.The problems have been due largely to dealings Enron had with private partn=erships, run by some of its own executives, under investigation by the Secu=rities and Exchange Commission. In an SEC filing Monday, Enron disclosed hu=ndreds of millions of potential additional write-offs as well as the possib=ility that its weakening financial condition could force it to repay more t=han $2 billion in loans by the end of the year.=20As of 4 p.m. Wednesday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron =shares fell $1.98, or 28%, to $5.01 each after having dropped 23% Tuesday. =In excess of 115 million shares traded Wednesday, more than four times the =volume of any other Big Board stock. Enron s bonds also again traded sharpl=y lower, market observers said.=20The turmoil spilled over to Dynegy s stock, which also was among the most a=ctively traded on the New York Stock Exchange. As of 4 p.m. Wednesday, Dyne=gy shares fell $1.94 to $39.76 each.=20On Wednesday, Dynegy issued a statement in which Chairman and Chief Executi=ve Chuck Watson said his company was working ""to accelerate the regulatory =approvals required to complete the merger in accordance with the previously= announced agreement"" though it continued to perform ""due diligence"" on Enr=on.=20Under the merger agreement, Dynegy has opportunities to renegotiate or walk= away from the deal if Enron s financial and legal problems become severe e=nough. However, some observers said it can be difficult to invoke these so-=called material adverse change clauses. They point to a decision earlier th=is year by a Delaware Chancery Court judge who forced Tyson Foods Inc. to c=omplete a planned purchase of IBP Inc. even though Tyson, a Springdale, Ark=., food-products company, had wanted to cancel the transaction because of a= drop in IBP s earnings and accounting problems at an IBP unit.=20Dynegy officials didn t return calls seeking comment. To complete the deal,= two-thirds of Dynegy shareholders and a majority of Enron shareholders wou=ld have to give their approval. No dates for those votes have been set.=20One person familiar with the merger plans said the SEC filing Monday by Enr=on contained information Dynegy hadn t known about. Dynegy representatives =planned to work through the weekend evaluating the importance of this new i=nformation as part of the company s due diligence, this person said. It cou=ldn t be determined what the new information was.=20The merger agreement, announced Nov. 9, calls for Dynegy to exchange 0.2685= share for each of Enron s roughly 850 million fully diluted shares, giving= the purchase a value of about $9 billion at Dynegy s current stock price. =However, from a price standpoint, the deal is appearing less attractive to =Dynegy.=20On the day of the merger announcement, Enron shares were trading at about $=8.63 each, or about 83% of the purchase price under the exchange ratio. As =of Wednesday, Enron s market price was only about 47% of the merger-formula= price. Such a sharp deterioration is unusual following a merger announceme=nt, when the stock price of the company being acquired generally begins tra=ding relatively close to the offering price.=20Sentiment among Wall Street analysts also is turning against the merger. In=itially, many analysts lauded the merger as a move that would rescue Enron =and provide a major boost to Houston-based Dynegy. Dynegy and Enron officia=ls have predicted that the merger, supposed to be completed late next year,= would significantly and immediately increase Dynegy s earnings.=20Now analysts are challenging that assumption. Ron Barone, managing director= at UBS Warburg LLC, said he believes that because of Enron s financial pro=blems, a combined company would actually have lower earnings next year than= Dynegy would have by itself. Mr. Barone said he thinks a ""likely scenario""= is that the merger formula will be renegotiated sharply down to about 0.15= Dynegy share for each Enron share.=20Such a ratcheting down wouldn t be without precedent in the deal. According= to one person familiar with the merger negotiations, Dynegy reduced the ex=change formula at least once prior to the Nov. 9 announcement because of En=ron s rapidly sinking stock price, which at the beginning of this year was =above $80 a share.=20In perhaps the most significant sign of the turning tide on Wall Street, Go=ldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer lowered his ratings on Enron and Dynegy=. A longtime Enron fan, Mr. Fleischer issued a report expressing doubts tha=t the merger would help Dynegy s earnings and whether Enron could ""recover =the significant business that has been lost"" in its giant energy-trading op=erations. ""The Enron machine continues to sputter,"" Mr. Fleischer wrote.=20Some observers say that if Dynegy walked away from the deal or tried to ren=egotiate the terms significantly, Enron might be pushed into a bankruptcy-l=aw filing. Without the Dynegy acquisition and continued support from its ba=nkers and customers, an Enron bankruptcy-court filing ""is highly possible,""= said Ralph Pellecchia, a senior director at Fitch, a credit-ratings agency=. On Wednesday, Fitch maintained its credit rating on Enron at just one not=ch above noninvestment-grade, or ""junk,"" status. But Fitch also said it bel=ieved Enron s trading partners had made ""significant cash collateral calls""= in recent days that are ""well in excess of previous expectations,"" contrib=uting to ""liquidity pressures.""=20Among the advisers Enron has hired during its current crisis is the law fir=m of Weil, Gotshal & Manges, which specializes in bankruptcy and corporate-=workout situations. Asked about a possible bankruptcy filing, an Enron spok=eswoman said the company expects the Dynegy deal to go through and therefor=e doesn t expect to have to look at alternatives to the merger. Since the m=erger announcement, Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay has said his company had alt=ernatives to the Dynegy deal but he has declined to identify them. Enron sa=id it made some progress improving its financial position. The company said= it reached a final agreement with units of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Cit=igroup Inc. on the remaining $450 million of a previously announced $1 bill=ion in secured credit lines. Enron said lenders had agreed to extend repaym=ent of an existing $690 million note to mid-December from next week. The sp=okeswoman said a restructuring of that obligation is expected to be complet=ed next month so that repayment wouldn t be required this year.=20---=20Thaddeus Herrick and Robin Sidel contributed to this article.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Amid growing disclosur=es of financial problems in recent weeks, the company ""locked down"" the ret=irement plan from Oct. 17 to Nov. 19 to make administrative changes, which =prevented employees from selling Enron shares as the share price collapsed.Enron, which recently agreed to be acquired by Dynegy Inc., Houston, becaus=e of mounting financial problems, has seen its stock price fall to $5.01 on= Wednesday from a peak of nearly $90 a share last year. The decline has bee=n costly to participants in Enron s retirement plan because more than 60% o=f the 401(k) assets were invested in Enron shares at the end of last year, =according to one of the suits.=20The first suit was filed Nov. 13 on behalf of plan participants by Campbell= Harrison & Wright LLP, a Houston law firm, and the second was filed Tuesda=y by Seattle-based Hagens Berman LLP. Both seek class-action certification.==20Enron said its corporate policy is not to comment on pending lawsuits. A sp=okeswoman also said the company s 401(k) plan offers participants 18 invest=ment choices, one of which is company stock.=20The company s stock has fallen amid mounting losses and disclosures that it= had extensive off-balance-sheet dealings with a web of partnerships headed= by former company officials. The Securities and Exchange Commission has la=unched a formal investigation into the company s accounting, and Enron has =said it will restate years of financial information.=20The suits against Enron are the latest of a series of suits filed against c=ompanies over losses in the company-stock portion of their 401(k) plans. Th=e suits allege the plan trustees breached their fiduciary duties by continu=ing to offer company stock, even after they became aware of serious busines=s problems that would hurt the stock price. All the suits are pending.=20As with most of these companies, Enron matches employee contributions to th=e 401(k) with shares of Enron stock, and also offers Enron stock as an inve=stment choice, in addition to a variety of mutual funds. About $1.3 billion= of the plan s $2.1 billion in assets was invested in Enron shares at the e=nd of 2000, according to the suit filed by Campbell Harrison.=20Pamela Tittle, a participant in the 401(k) plan who worked in the finance d=epartment and a named plaintiff in the Enron suit filed by Campbell Harriso=n & Wright, had roughly 2,000 shares of Enron stock in her retirement accou=nt and has suffered losses of about $140,000 as a result of the stock s dec=line.

In additi=on, it accuses Enron of systematically misrepresenting its financial result=s since 1998 in connection with the partnerships under investigation by the= SEC.=20Roy E. Rinard, a lineman for Enron in Oregon who is a named plaintiff in th=e suit filed by Hagens Berman, has seen the value of his retirement plan fa=ll to $70,000 from $470,000, largely as a result of the decline in Enron s =stock. ""I feel like I have been betrayed,"" Mr. Rinard said in press release= issued by his lawyers. ""I lost my savings, my plans for the future, everyt=hing.""=20Under federal pension law, companies are allowed to offer their own stock i=n retirement plans, and are allowed to force employees to hold onto the sto=ck. Enron doesn t let employees diversify out of shares they receive as mat=ching contributions to the 401(k) plan until age 50.=20However, plan trustees are supposed to operate the plan in the best interes=ts of the participants, which includes choosing prudent investments. Genera=lly, to prove that the plan s administrators breached their fiduciary dutie=s, employees must show that the trustees knew the stock was a bad investmen=t. This presents a high hurdle, so it is not surprising that prior lawsuits= over losses in company stock in 401(k) plans have generally come in the wa=ke of allegations of accounting irregularities.=20Lynn Sarko, one of Ms. Tittle s attorneys with Seattle s Keller Rohrback LL=P, is also co-lead counsel in a similar lawsuit against Lucent Technologies= Inc., Murray Hill, N.J.

The two law firms are representing M=s.

Repr=esentatives for Ikon and Lucent say their companies didn t require employee=s to invest in the company stock, and educated employees about the need for= diversification.=20The suit in which Mr. Rinard is plaintiff notes that on Oct. 17, a day afte=r Enron announced the company was taking a nonrecurring charge totaling $1.=01 billion in the third quarter, Enron ""locked down"" the 401(k) plan s asse=ts, preventing participants from selling Enron shares. (A ""lock-down"" occur=s when a retirement plan is transferred from one administrator to another, =and generally lasts several weeks, during which time participants can t mak=e changes in their investment choices).=20The lock-down was lifted on Nov. 19. In the interim, on Nov. 8, Enron annou=nced it would be forced to restate downward its reported financial results =from 1997 through 2000. By the time the lock-down was lifted, as a result o=f all the negative news the shares had fallen to below $9 a share from $32.=20 on Oct. 17, when the lockup started, Hagens Berman attorney Karl Barth s=aid.=20""They were locked into it right when Enron knew it was going to be announci=ng some really bad news,"" Mr. Barth said.

The Securities =and Exchange Commission filed civil fraud complaints against the Andersen p=artner who audited Sunbeam and against the firm itself in the Waste Managem=ent case.=20Now Enron has repudiated the financial statements that were certified by Ar=thur Andersen, in the process shaving more than half a billion dollars from= the company s reported profits in recent years.All of which raises the question: Has Arthur Andersen become the black shee=p of the accounting industry?=20It is not an easy question to answer, and not everyone is willing to rush t=o judgment.   If you want to attack Andersen for Enron, you need to know mo=re than we know,   Arthur Levitt, the former chairman of the Securities and= Exchange Commission, said this week.=20But if there is a thread connecting what is known about the three cases, it= is materiality. In all three cases, Andersen auditors spotted bad accounti=ng but were persuaded it was immaterial and therefore allowed it to go ahea=d.=20Materiality is one of those flexible concepts that can get accountants into= trouble. The idea is that it doesn t much matter if a few little things we=re gotten wrong. But they can add up.=20At Enron, however, they did not add up to that much -- a total of $93 milli=on over four years. The biggest restatement of Enron profits concerns a rel=ated party that Enron now says should have been consolidated. It is not cle=ar if Andersen had the facts needed to make that decision at the time.=20To those who treasure the role of auditors, the humiliation of Andersen is =painful. Back in the 1950 s, it was Leonard Spacek, Andersen s managing par=tner, who warned that   the profession s existence is in peril   because it= was not showing enough independence. His public prodding was crucial in ma=king the industry do a better job. Two decades ago, when the issue on the t=able was pension accounting, Andersen was the only major accounting firm to= break with clients and push for good rules.=20Now Andersen s backbone is open to question. It was evidence that senior pe=ople at Andersen repeatedly gave in to pressure from Waste Management that =led the S.E.C. to bring that suit, which the firm chose to settle without a=dmitting it had done anything wrong. The partner that the S.E.C. says looke=d the other way at Sunbeam is fighting the accusations, and Andersen says h=e acted properly.=20Lynn Turner, who was chief accountant of the S.E.C. at the time and is now =director of the Center for Quality Financial Reporting at Colorado State Un=iversity, says what is happening to Andersen now is reminiscent of what hap=pened to Coopers & Lybrand when he was a partner there and the firm had a s=eries of highly publicized blown audits.=20  We got bludgeoned to death in the press,   he said.   People did not even= want to see us at their doorsteps. It was brutal, but we deserved it. We h=ad gotten into this mentality in the firm of making business judgment calls=.   By that he meant that the firm paid too much attention to not offending= clients and not enough to good accounting.=20For Andersen to avoid that fate, its relatively new chief executive, Joseph= Berardino, who declined to be interviewed for this column, will need to se=t a tone inside the firm making clear that he expects auditors to show the =backbone that Mr. Spacek epitomized. And then he will have to convince the =public of that.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. =09Business/Financial Desk; Section CChase and J. P. Morgan s Paper AnniversaryA Year After the Merger, Rosy Plans Meet RealityBy RIVA D. ATLAS11/23/2001The New York TimesPage 1, Column 5c. 2001 New York Times CompanyWhen William B. Harrison Jr. speaks of last year s $31 billion merger of J.= P. Morgan and the Chase Manhattan Corporation, he speaks proudly of a deal= that he considers to be a capstone to his 34-year career of helping build =a giant of the banking business.=20  This is the first merger I ve been part of,   said Mr. Harrison, the chie=f executive of the combined bank,   where I feel our core business is compl=ete.  The Chase-J. P. Morgan combination helped advance the bank into the investm=ent banking elite, just as Mr. Harrison intended. But with Wall Street and =the economy in far different places today than they were when the deal was =put together, the many mergers, stock sales and other money-making opportun=ities that were supposed to justify the high-priced acquisition have largel=y dried up for now.=20Consequently, deal makers and analysts who follow the bank are already spec=ulating that Mr. Harrison, 58, may ultimately be compelled to do yet anothe=r large deal, this time to diversify his business away from its heavy empha=sis on Wall Street.=20J. P. Morgan Chase has won some prominent assignments, like handling the re=vampings of troubled giants like Lucent and, more recently, Enron, the bele=aguered energy trading company.=20But while J. P. Morgan Chase is proud of serving alongside Citigroup as bot=h lead lender and adviser to Enron on its acquisition by Dynegy, the dual r=ole it has worked to achieve sometimes proves complicated for the bank. Wit=h Enron s shares in free fall as more information comes out about its hidde=n debts, J. P. Morgan Chase has been scrambling to maintain the support of =other banks while simultaneously keeping the merger with Dynegy on track.==20Thanks largely to the slump on Wall Street, J. P. Morgan Chase s profits fe=ll by two-thirds in the third quarter, to $449 million from $1.4 billion in= the period a year ago. Its stock has dropped 15 percent this year, more th=an other banks  shares. The bank s stock is ahead of investment banks like =Goldman Sachs, with which J. P. Morgan Chase increasingly competes.=20  The jury is still out in many respects on this merger,   said Judah Kraus=haar, an analyst at Merrill Lynch. Nevertheless, he likes J. P. Morgan Chas=e s stock, he said, because   expectations are very low.  =20All J. P. Morgan Chase s competitors are suffering from the slowdown on Wal=l Street. But some, like Citigroup, are better diversified and have greater= involvement in old-fashioned consumer banking, which is proving to be a st=rong moneymaker this year.=20Nearly a third of J. P. Morgan Chase s revenues are consumer-oriented. By c=ontrast, its chief New York rival, Citigroup, gets half its revenues from c=onsumer businesses.=20  The timing of the merger was bad,   said Steven Wharton, a banking analys=t at Loomis, Sayles & Company, which owns about a million J. P. Morgan Chas=e shares.   There s no disputing that.  =20Actually, Mr. Harrison disputes it.   I can t tell you how happy I am about= having done this merger,   he said in a recent interview.   While there ar=e pluses and minuses to operating in a weak economic environment, we have a= much stronger platform to manage with during this difficult time.  =20In Mr. Harrison s favor is his battle-tested team of top executives who hav=e worked together for a decade or more. Few executives remain in the top sp=ots from the old J. P. Morgan. Instead, most major posts are filled by mana=gers who have worked with Mr. Harrison since his days at Chemical Bank, whe=re he spent most of his career. Mr. Harrison s team successfully gobbled up= Manufacturers Hanover Bank in 1991, then followed that with Chemical s mer=ger with Chase Manhattan in 1996 before incorporating Morgan into the fold =last year.=20The group of Chemical veterans includes Marc J. Shapiro, who oversees finan=ce and risk management at J. P. Morgan Chase; Donald H. Layton, one of two =leaders of investment banking; and James B. Lee Jr., the bank s senior deal= maker. The team also includes Dina Dublon, the bank s chief financial offi=cer.=20Two other senior executives have also lived through big deals. Geoffrey T. =Boisi, the other investment banking leader, was the one-time investment ban=king chief at Goldman, Sachs. David A. Coulter, in charge of Chase s retail= bank, had been chief executive of Bank of America before it was bought by =NationsBank.=20  There aren t many teams that have gone through as many mergers as Bill Ha=rrison and his team,   said Mark G. Solow, managing principal at GarMark Ad=visors, an investment firm, and a former senior executive at Chemical.=20Still, Ms. Dublon acknowledged that the tough economy was making the J. P. =Morgan takeover more difficult than the earlier combinations.=20  In general, mergers are very hard on morale,   she said.   There is no qu=estion that this one has a tougher emotional toll.  =20The bank s executives are making the best of a bad situation. They have tak=en advantage of the slowdown to cut around 8 percent of the combined banks = staff, or about 2,500 more employees than anticipated at the time the merg=er was announced.=20Many of these job cuts were aimed at high-cost investment bankers: J. P. Mo=rgan Chase expects that 6,000 jobs in its investment banking division will =have been eliminated by the end of the year.=20  We have focused on the tougher jobs to cut,   Ms. Dublon said.=20In some ways the overall market turmoil has made it easier for J. P. Morgan= Chase to overhaul its staff. With fewer jobs available on Wall Street, Mr.= Shapiro said, the employees who are left behind are less apt to complain a=bout changes in their jobs.   People have fewer options,   he said,   so yo=u have a little more control over the process.  =20Thanks partly to these cuts, the bank estimates the saving from cost cuttin=g will be $3.6 billion annually, compared with an original projection of $2= billion at the time of the merger.=20The cost cutting has helped compensate somewhat for a sharp drop in profits= in the bank s core businesses.   What we can control and are managing very= aggressively is the expenses of the company,   Ms. Dublon said in a confer=ence call with reporters on Oct. 17, the day earnings were announced.=20Aside from cost cuts, the weakness on Wall Street makes it hard for the ban=k s executives to point to tangible gains in investment banking, where fees= were down 24 percent in the third quarter. But Mr. Harrison points to mark=et-share gains the bank has achieved at the expense of competitors on Wall =Street. He hopes that when the investment banking business revives, J. P. M=organ Chase will hold on to these gains.=20The bank is particularly proud of its standing in two areas: mergers and ac=quisitions, and the underwriting of large investment-grade bond deals.=20The bank ranked 5th worldwide in the highly profitable category of advising= on mergers during the first nine months of 2001, up from Chase s 12th-plac=e finish and J. P. Morgan s 10th-place standing during the same period last= year, according to Thomson Financial Securities data.=20The merger and acquisitions business, which Chase had been slowly building =for years, is stronger following the merger with J. P. Morgan, said Mr. Lee=, a vice chairman at the bank. As a result, the bank is able to win assignm=ents providing advice to customers who dealt with the old Chase only for lo=ans.=20Mr. Lee remains proud of the bank s work with Enron, the energy company, de=spite its troubles. J. P. Morgan Chase, along with Citigroup, raised $1 bil=lion in bank financing for Enron earlier this month. It was also hired to a=dvise the company, which hopes to be saved from collapse by being taken ove=r by Dynegy.=20The old Chase, long a lending powerhouse, would have had a good shot at lea=ding the bank financing, but an advisory role would have been less certain.= Mr. Lee said the investment banker advising Enron came from the old J. P. =Morgan. But with merger activity slow, there are few such deals to go aroun=d.=20The bank is also proud of its strength in long-term investment-grade bonds,= another area that business executives say has been enhanced by the merger.= It moved up to second place in that area so far this year, compared with s=ixth place a year ago.=20The bank has taken advantage of a boom in large corporate bond offerings, a= surge driven by today s low interest rates. In May J. P. Morgan Chase rais=ed $12 billion in bonds for WorldCom, the telecommunications company, in th=e largest corporate debt deal in the United States on record.=20Unfortunately for J. P. Morgan Chase, the fees for underwriting investment-=grade debt are small compared with the money to be earned coordinating offe=rings of stock, where J. P. Morgan Chase remains a second-tier competitor.==20The bank actually lost market share in the rankings for underwriters of sto=ck, falling to 9th place this year, compared with the old J. P. Morgan s 6t=h-place finish a year ago. (Chase was 11th.)=20Mr. Harrison said the bank was taking advantage of the slowdown in stock of=ferings to build momentum slowly in that business.   We think we have a cha=nce in the second half of this year to be in the top five,   he said.=20Given the slowdown, some bankers predict that Mr. Harrison will ultimately =do another deal, either to expand his consumer banking business or to bolst=er weak areas in investment banking, like the equity division.=20  The general view is that the combination with J. P. Morgan didn t do enou=gh,   one investment banker said.=20Mr. Harrison disagrees:   I don t feel,   he said,   we need to do another =large deal to be successful.  Photo: William B. Harrison Jr., the chief executive, says he has no doubts =about the wisdom of forming J. P. Morgan Chase, even though the the economy= has slowed since then.

That wa=s followed by renewed volatility in power prices, and this time the prices =were headed down, not up.=20And then came a crushing blow against trading firms - the unraveling of the= industry s largest player, Enron Corp. (ENE).=20Simply put, the perfect storm stalled, and a business once buoyed by high g=as prices, strong demand and tight supply now lies in tatters.=20The stocks of companies whom some say should be valued more like growth sto=cks than utilities are instead mired at around nine-times earnings - about =where traditional utilities trade.=20And the chance for recovery in 2002?=20Basu Mullick, portfolio manager of the Neuberger Berman Partners fund, is w=illing to bet there is. He thinks energy traders deserve at least the same =price-to-earnings multiple as the broader market s median, which is current=ly between 16- to 17-times future earnings, he said. It s just a matter of =time before the stocks get there.=20""They were just recovering from Gray Davis,"" Mullick said, referring to the= governor of California, who had accused ""out-of-state"" energy traders of a=rtificially inflating the price of power in the state, and triggering the s=tate s energy crisis. ""Now, they are recovering from Enron.""=20The fund manager also blames lower commodity prices, warm weather and poor =demand for the recent weak performance in the group.=20""Energy convergence companies are putting up terrific growth rates,"" he sai=d. ""I don t think they should get the same valuation as a garden-variety ut=ility.""=20Still, others think the stock market is continuing to make distinctions bet=ween the energy traders by taking a harder look at the companies  strategie=s and financial disclosures.=20Enron s precarious financial situation underscores the importance of accoun=ting issues. Although many of Enron s financial problems aren t solely the =fault of mark-to-market accounting issues, there has been growing attention= paid to this form of financial reporting because of the earnings volatilit=y it can create.=20Answers Elude Investors=20Investors are asking hard questions, and not always getting the answers the=y want.=20Using mark-to-market methods, a company calculates the fair market value of= a commodity position - whether it s a contract, an option, a swap, etc. - =at the time, even if the value of the position is realized over a longer pe=riod. The problem with this method is the actual cash a company realizes fr=om the position might not be the same value the company calculated in its o=riginal assessment. Also, sometimes it isn t easy to calculate the fair val=ue of the commodity position. This is particularly true in instances where =the market for the commodity isn t liquid.=20Over time, companies with the highest level of disclosure regarding their m=ark-to-market gains will most likely trade at higher multiples to counterpa=rts that provide little or no disclosure, said ABN AMRO Inc. analyst Paul P=atterson.=20Encouragingly, it appears companies may already be responding to the call f=or added disclosure. According to a survey Patterson conducted, more compan=ies with energy trading units were willing to disclose the details of their= mark-to-market accounting practices during third-quarter conference calls =compared with those in the second quarter.=20Patterson said he prefers earnings that are cash-based.=20""All things being equal, we believe reported earnings that more closely ref=lect the timely realization of cash have a higher quality associated with t=hem than earnings that do not,"" he said.=20He expects investors to become smarter and learn to distinguish between ear=nings growth through accrual accounting and growth fueled by mark-to-market= accounting.=20At the end of the day, it is not a matter of simply producing profits, but =being able to say where those earnings came from, said one investor, who ma=nages a pension fund.=20Some investors also may be placing a greater emphasis on the cash flow the =energy merchants produce.=20Tim O Brien, portfolio manager of the Gabelli Utilities Fund, said energy m=erchants that own the physical power assets to back up their trading positi=ons should trade at a premium to an independent power producers and traditi=onal utility companies. Still, the stocks should be valued at less than the= growth rate of the company because of their heavy exposures to commodity p=rices.=20Energy merchants include companies such as Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Duke Energy C=orp. (DUK) and Dominion Resources Inc. (D).=20According to O Brien, the group never deserved to have the price-to-earning=s multiples above 20- to 30-times earnings, which were once paid for the st=ocks.=20""We all got sucked up by the up-leg of the cycle and forgot just how cyclic=al these companies are,"" O Brien said, adding that the average multiple sho=uld be in the high single-digits to the high-teens.=20As for independent power producers - which are companies without regulated =operations that own power plants to generate electricity to sell and trade =in the wholesale market - the group may wind up being valued on the basis o=f the replacement costs of the assets in their portfolio, according to O Br=ien.=20""One analogy is that they are basically like commercial real-estate plays,""= O Brien said.=20That could mean stocks such as Calpine Corp. (CPN), which is already in the= lower-half of its trading range, may have further to fall.=20-By Christina Cheddar, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5166; christina.cheddar=@dowjones.comCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

It is also exploring the idea of alliances with oth=er exchanges, and considering developing ""e-mini"" contracts - smaller energ=y contracts for Internet-based trade by retail investors.=20""There s new management in place at the exchange,"" said Nymex spokeswoman N=achamah Jacobovits. ""They re rethinking all of our business strategies, and= one very massive strategy was the idea of this major eNymex B2B (business-=to-business) system launch with a whole new slate of products.""=20Nymex and GlobalView Software Inc., a company that initially worked on buil=ding the eNymex trading system, have sued each other in a dispute over work= on the project.=20Kiodex, an electronic-trading technology firm that has developed the back e=nd of the eNymex system, took on added development work for the project aft=er GlobalView departed. The trade engine Kiodex was asked to build is ""subs=tantially complete, but the company can t speak to Nymex s overall electron=ic-trading strategy,"" a Kiodex source said.=20The eNymex platform was conceived as a forum for trading over-the-counter e=nergy products, but Nymex has already moved ahead with plans for trading so=me of them on Access, initially an overnight trading system that was expand=ed in September. It hopes, for example, to launch gas swaps based on delive=ry at the Henry Hub within the next six weeks on Access, Jacobovits said.==20""We ve expedited plans for a Henry Hub natural gas swap contract,"" Jacobovi=ts said. ""Traders could be looking for OTC clearing on a neutral-based plat=form, which is a factor in that decision.""=20Before Sept. 14, Access was used only to trade energy futures at night, aft=er the day s Nymex session had ended. Use was limited to Nymex members with= dedicated phone systems.=20The exchange had been planning to expand use of Access, but ended up doing =so sooner than it had expected. On Sept. 14, it started offering Access tra=ding over the Internet, a move that will eventually allow Nymex to open up =trade to more users.=20The move was intended to help keep futures markets liquid after the Sept. 1=1 attack on the World Trade Center. Nymex s building, located near where th=e trade towers stood, was shut down for several days after the attacks. Exp=anding its already existent Access system to the Internet helped ease poten=tial liquidity problems that could have arisen from shortened floor trading= hours after Nymex reopened.=20Development of the eNymex system began last year under the direction of for=mer Nymex Chairman Daniel Rappaport. In August, Nymex said it would launch =the eNymex platform within four to eight months. New Nymex President J. Rob=ert ""Bo"" Collins Jr. said then that vendor problems had slowed development =of the system s front-end technology and caused the delays. But he still ex=pected eNymex to launch without any meaningful changes to its original prod=uct line.=20If Nymex combines parts or all of the platform originally intended as eNyme=x with Access, the new system may end up being known as eNymex.=20""eNymex right now is looking for a new mission,"" said an industry source cl=ose to Nymex. ""You know how politics works. We don t scrap it, we just rena=me it. Anything we do electronically is now going to be called eNymex. But =the original deal and concept that Rappaport initiated is done.""=20Nymex s reconsideration comes as the energy-trading world undergoes rapid c=hange. The two most successful online energy trading platforms -- Enron Cor=p. s (ENE) EnronOnline, and IntercontinentalExchange, or ICE -- have seen t=heir luck turn - in opposite directions.=20Enron Corp. (ENE), which accounts for about 25% of the trade in U.S. power =and gas markets, faces questions about its creditworthiness as the Securiti=es and Exchange Commission investigates complicated financial dealings. Enr=on s possible merger with Dynegy Inc. (DYN), now appears to be in doubt, an=d energy trading companies are pulling back their exposure to the company.==20Enron executes about 60% of its power and gas trades on EnronOnline. When E=nron s troubles surfaced last month, Nymex quickly moved to extend its clea=ring services to over-the-counter natural gas derivatives, a move the tradi=ng community saw as an attempt to grab market share.=20ICE, on the other hand, is moving ahead with plans to capture more energy t=rade on its electronic format. ICE closed a deal this summer to acquire the= London-based International Petroleum Exchange - Nymex s chief competitor a=nd Europe s largest traditional energy exchange. It plans to move all IPE e=nergy contracts to its Internet-based system and offer clearing services fo=r some over-the-counter contracts.=20Nymex is exploring alliances that could give it a better footing in the new= competitive landscape. One idea under review is a joint venture with the C=hicago Mercantile Exchange to offer e-mini contracts for Nymex products on =CME s Globex electronic-trading system, the person close to Nymex said.=20Nymex officials wouldn t confirm whether they re talking with the CME, but =they said the relationship between the exchanges is a warm one.=20""Nymex is always open to strategic alliances,"" Jacobovits said. ""There s no=thing we ve agreed to at this point, but we have open dialogue with a numbe=r of exchanges concerning strategic alliances. We have a good relationship =with the Chicago Merc, and we certainly would be open to working with them.=""=20Shortly after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in New York shut down the Nyme=x trading floor, the CME said it would be willing to offer Nymex products o=n its Globex system until Nymex resumed operations, Jacobovits said.=20-By Stephen Parker, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-4426; stephen.parker@dowjo=nes.comCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

(ENE) tried to put on a good face Wednesday by issuing a press r=elease touting, among other things, increased liquidity.The problem is that most of the so-called news was three days old, recycled= from the company s latest quarterly filing.=20And investors weren t fooled by the release. Although the stock of the emba=ttled Houston energy trader regained some ground immediately after the rele=ase, climbing to $5.35 a share from $4.60, it quickly gave up most of its g=ains. One hour after the release, Enron stock was back trading at $4.98 a s=hare, down more than 28% on the day.=20""They had to say something, but really didn t have any new news. It s quite= incredible,"" said a Wall Street analyst covering Enron.=20Amid mounting fears that Enron s credit woes could thwart its plan to merge= with rival Dynegy Inc. (DYN), a merger that many see as the only way for E=nron to avoid possible bankruptcy, Enron began its press release by announc=ing that ""it has closed on the remaining $450 million of a previously annou=nced $1 billion in secured credit lines...""=20Great news, given the way Enron has been burning through cash. Except that =investors who took time to read Enron s filing with the Securities and Exch=ange Commission on Monday already knew that ""on November 19, 2001, Enron cl=osed a $450 million new secured line of credit, which will mature in the fo=urth quarter of 2002."" Readers of the company s 10-Q also knew that the $45=0 million credit was secured by the assets of Enron s Northern Natural Gas =Co.=20Meanwhile, the real news everyone was waiting for, an announcement about wh=ether a $690 million loan due next Tuesday had been extended, has yet to be= finalized.=20Enron said in its release that it expected that an extension to mid-Decembe=r would be formalized soon.=20Separately, people familiar with the matter said J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. an=d Citigroup Inc. continue to work with Enron to extend the maturity of the =syndicated loan, which contains a clause that, unbeknownst to many, was tri=ggered by Enron s ratings downgrade to ""BBB-"" by Standard & Poor s Corp. ea=rlier this month. The clause stipulated that Enron would have to repay the =$690 million note on November 27 if it didn t post collateral.=20Those people said that the syndicated loan, which is built inside a structu=red vehicle used to finance minority interests in power and energy sectors =around the world, would likely be extended to the middle of 2002 when other= bank loans to Enron come due. About $1.75 billion of Enron s $3.5 billion =in syndicated bank loans come due in May 2002 and will likely need to be re=structured.=20About $250 million of the assets securing the $690 million loan are in the =process of being sold and will be used to pay down the loan, reducing the o=utstanding portion of the loan that will need to be restructured, according= to the people familiar with the terms.=20Meanwhile, Dynegy also tried to rally, although somewhat halfheartedly, inv=estors around its plan to acquire Enron s stock. Dynegy said it was encoura=ged by reports that Enron closed on its remaining $450 million credit facil=ity and news of the extension of the $690 million loan. Under the terms of =the acquisition, Enron holders would receive 0.2685 Dynegy share for each E=nron share.=20Investors, however, remain more circumspect, unmoved by the whopping 104% r=isk premium currently attached to the merger. (That s how much investors bu=ying Enron shares would make if the deal was closing Wednesday.)=20Aside from continued worries about how much bad news may still come, analys=ts and traders appear particularly concerned with Enron s liquidity, or lac=k thereof, going forward.=20""We re having a hard time believing that this new credit infusion (from the= banks), even with the $1.5 billion from Dynegy, will provide enough liquid=ity for Enron,"" one risk arbitrageur at a New York hedge fund said.=20As part of the merger agreement between Dynegy and Enron, Chevron Texaco, w=hich owns 26% of Dynegy, already injected $1.5 billion into Enron.

Analysts expect layoffs if the merger occurs.Continental announced a layoff of 3,000 employees after the Sept. 11 attack=s and Hewlett-Packard Co. s plan to buy Compaq Computer Corp. will, if fina=lized, result in 15,000 layoffs at the two companies. Compaq also announced= 8,000 layoffs worldwide in July.=20""It s fair to say that the potential layoffs at Enron and the layoffs at Co=ntinental, taken alone, are negative factors, although probably small in th=e grand scope of the Houston economy,"" said Phil Scheps, director of Housto=n s finance and administration department.=20Since last month when Enron became a target of a Securities and Exchange Co=mmission investigation into financial dealings with partnerships, the energ=y giant s market share has steadily eroded.=20While neither Enron nor Dynegy have given any indication of the number of l=ayoffs that could hit Houston, Barton Smith, director of the Institute for =Regional Forecasting at the University of Houston, said the layoffs ""will b=e spread out over a long period of time and will not be excessive.""=20Robin Kapiloff, an analyst at Moody s Investors Service, said the city s ef=forts to diversify its economy over the past decade will protect its revenu=e collections, even as some of the city s biggest employers suffer.

Next year the city s tax =base is estimated to grow to $95 billion.=20Still, the national recession, energy price weakness in general, and the in=itial loss of consumer confidence related to the attacks has caused the cit=y to reduce its estimate of sales tax growth to 1.5 percent from 5 percent.= That revised estimate equals a $13 million reduction in the city s $1.4 bi=llion budget.=20But the city s property tax revenue has not been affected.

Du=ring the past month, Enron has taken a $1 billion write-off of assets, revi=sed downward the earnings of the past several years and taken a $1.2 billio=n reduction in shareholder equity.The problems have been due largely to dealings Enron had with private partn=erships, run by some of its own executives, under investigation by the Secu=rities and Exchange Commission. In an SEC filing Monday, Enron disclosed hu=ndreds of millions of potential additional write-offs as well as the possib=ility that its weakening financial condition could force it to repay more t=han $2 billion in loans by the end of the year.=20As of 4 p.m. Wednesday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron =shares fell $1.98, or 28%, to $5.01 each after having dropped 23% Tuesday. =In excess of 115 million shares traded Wednesday, more than four times the =volume of any other Big Board stock. Enron s bonds also again traded sharpl=y lower, market observers said.=20The turmoil spilled over to Dynegy s stock, which also was among the most a=ctively traded on the New York Stock Exchange. As of 4 p.m. Wednesday, Dyne=gy (DYN) shares fell $1.94 to $39.76 each.=20On Wednesday, Dynegy issued a statement in which Chairman and Chief Executi=ve Chuck Watson said his company was working ""to accelerate the regulatory =approvals required to complete the merger in accordance with the previously= announced agreement"" though it continued to perform ""due diligence"" on Enr=on.=20Under the merger agreement, Dynegy has opportunities to renegotiate or walk= away from the deal if Enron s financial and legal problems become severe e=nough. However, some observers said it can be difficult to invoke these so-=called material adverse change clauses. They point to a decision earlier th=is year by a Delaware Chancery Court judge who forced Tyson Foods Inc. to c=omplete a planned purchase of IBP Inc. even though Tyson, a Springdale, Ark=., food-products company, had wanted to cancel the transaction because of a= drop in IBP s earnings and accounting problems at an IBP unit.=20Dynegy officials didn t return calls seeking comment. To complete the deal,= two-thirds of Dynegy shareholders and a majority of Enron shareholders wou=ld have to give their approval. No dates for those votes have been set.=20One person familiar with the merger plans said the SEC filing Monday by Enr=on contained information Dynegy hadn t known about. Dynegy representatives =planned to work through the weekend evaluating the importance of this new i=nformation as part of the company s due diligence, this person said. It cou=ldn t be determined what the new information was.=20The merger agreement, announced Nov. 9, calls for Dynegy to exchange 0.2685= share for each of Enron s roughly 850 million fully diluted shares, giving= the purchase a value of about $9 billion at Dynegy s current stock price. =However, from a price standpoint, the deal is appearing less attractive to =Dynegy.=20On the day of the merger announcement, Enron shares were trading at about $=8.63 each, or about 83% of the purchase price under the exchange ratio. As =of Wednesday, Enron s market price was only about 47% of the merger-formula= price. Such a sharp deterioration is unusual following a merger announceme=nt, when the stock price of the company being acquired generally begins tra=ding relatively close to the offering price.=20Sentiment among Wall Street analysts also is turning against the merger. In=itially, many analysts lauded the merger as a move that would rescue Enron =and provide a major boost to Houston-based Dynegy. Dynegy and Enron officia=ls have predicted that the merger, supposed to be completed late next year,= would significantly and immediately increase Dynegy s earnings.=20Now analysts are challenging that assumption. Ron Barone, managing director= at UBS Warburg LLC, said he believes that because of Enron s financial pro=blems, a combined company would actually have lower earnings next year than= Dynegy would have by itself. Mr. Barone said he thinks a ""likely scenario""= is that the merger formula will be renegotiated sharply down to about 0.15= Dynegy share for each Enron share.=20Copyright (c) 2001 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.=20All Rights Reserved............................................................................=..........................................................=20Financial Post InvestingEnron casts pall on analysts:  Everyone had a buy on the stock  all the way= downSteve MaichFinancial Post, with files from news services11/23/2001National Post=20NationalIN1 / Front(c) National Post 2001.

But with brokerages vying for the millions of do=llars in equity and bond underwriting business Enron provided every year, m=any analysts chose to focus on the company s growth, and failed to ask toug=h questions about its books.=20Critics say the red flags were waving long ago.=20The first clear sign of trouble came Aug. 14, when Jeffrey Skilling quit th=e CEO job he took over just seven months earlier, citing personal reasons. =Former chief executive Kenneth Lay reclaimed the job. ""Our business is stro=ng and our growth prospects have never been better,"" Mr. Lay said at the ti=me.=20In fact, cracks were already appearing in the business. Enron s plan to sta=rt trading capacity on fibre optic networks was a costly failure, and the c=ompany was locked in a prolonged dispute with the Indian government over en=ergy purchases in the region.=20In October, Enron surprised investors by reporting its first quarterly loss= in more than four years, due in large part to the writedown of US$1-billio=n in bad investments. Within a week, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commi=ssion started investigating Enron s finances.=20The company soon admitted major accounting errors dating back to 1997. Its =profits had been overstated by US$586-million, or 20%. The company revealed= that some of the investments it had written off were limited partnerships =headed by CFO Andrew Fastow -- a serious breach of good corporate governanc=e. Mr. Fastow was fired, but it didn t stop Enron s descent.=20The pain may be far from over.=20Facing a year of regulatory hearings to approve the merger, and a rapidly d=evaluing asset in Enron, many fear Dynegy will walk away from the deal. If =that happens, Enron may be doomed.=20The stock closed Wednesday at US$5.01, down 93% this year. Dynegy closed at= US$39.76, valuing the Enron offer at US$10.67 a share. The fact that Enron= s stock is trading so far below the offer price is a sure sign that invest=ors doubt it will proceed, at least not at the current offer price.=20All this has left investors wondering how so many could have been so wrong,= about so much. And how can so many continue to endorse the stock?=20Of the 18 analysts that cover the stock, 10 still rate it a ""buy.""

Amid growing disclosur=es of financial problems in recent weeks, the company ""locked down"" the ret=irement plan from Oct. 17 to Nov. 19 to make administrative changes, which =prevented employees from selling Enron shares as the share price collapsed.Enron, which recently agreed to be acquired by Dynegy Inc., Houston, becaus=e of mounting financial problems, has seen its stock price fall to $5.01 on= Wednesday from a peak of nearly $90 a share last year. The decline has bee=n costly to participants in Enron s retirement plan because more than 60% o=f the 401(k) assets were invested in Enron shares at the end of last year, =according to one of the suits.=20The first suit was filed Nov. 13 on behalf of plan participants by Campbell= Harrison & Wright LLP, a Houston law firm, and the second was filed Tuesda=y by Seattle-based Hagens Berman LLP. Both seek class-action certification.==20Enron said its corporate policy is not to comment on pending lawsuits. A sp=okeswoman also said the company s 401(k) plan offers participants 18 invest=ment choices, one of which is company stock.=20The company s stock has fallen amid mounting losses and disclosures that it= had extensive off-balance-sheet dealings with a web of partnerships headed= by former company officials. The Securities and Exchange Commission has la=unched a formal investigation into the company s accounting, and Enron has =said it will restate years of financial information.=20The suits against Enron are the latest of a series of suits filed against c=ompanies over losses in the company-stock portion of their 401(k) plans. Th=e suits allege the plan trustees breached their fiduciary duties by continu=ing to offer company stock, even after they became aware of serious busines=s problems that would hurt the stock price. All the suits are pending.=20As with most of these companies, Enron matches employee contributions to th=e 401(k) with shares of Enron stock, and also offers Enron stock as an inve=stment choice, in addition to a variety of mutual funds. About $1.3 billion= of the plan s $2.1 billion in assets was invested in Enron shares at the e=nd of 2000, according to the suit filed by Campbell Harrison.=20Pamela Tittle, a participant in the 401(k) plan who worked in the finance d=epartment and a named plaintiff in the Enron suit filed by Campbell Harriso=n & Wright, had roughly 2,000 shares of Enron stock in her retirement accou=nt and has suffered losses of about $140,000 as a result of the stock s dec=line. The suit alleges that the trustees of the Enron 401(k) plan violated =their fiduciary duties by not informing plan participants that the company =stock was in peril.=20The suit filed by Hagens Berman, also alleges that the company failed to wa=rn participants about risks of remaining invested in Enron stock. In additi=on, it accuses Enron of systematically misrepresenting its financial result=s since 1998 in connection with the partnerships under investigation by the= SEC.=20Roy E. Rinard, a lineman for Enron in Oregon who is a named plaintiff in th=e suit filed by Hagens Berman, has seen the value of his retirement plan fa=ll to $70,000 from $470,000, largely as a result of the decline in Enron s =stock. ""I feel like I have been betrayed,"" Mr. Rinard said in press release= issued by his lawyers. ""I lost my savings, my plans for the future, everyt=hing.""=20Under federal pension law, companies are allowed to offer their own stock i=n retirement plans, and are allowed to force employees to hold onto the sto=ck. Enron doesn t let employees diversify out of shares they receive as mat=ching contributions to the 401(k) plan until age 50.=20However, plan trustees are supposed to operate the plan in the best interes=ts of the participants, which includes choosing prudent investments. Genera=lly, to prove that the plan s administrators breached their fiduciary dutie=s, employees must show that the trustees knew the stock was a bad investmen=t. This presents a high hurdle, so it is not surprising that prior lawsuits= over losses in company stock in 401(k) plans have generally come in the wa=ke of allegations of accounting irregularities.=20Lynn Sarko, one of Ms. Tittle s attorneys with Seattle s Keller Rohrback LL=P, is also co-lead counsel in a similar lawsuit against Lucent Technologies= Inc., Murray Hill, N.J. Another firm representing Ms. Tittle is Dalton Got=to Samson & Kilgard PLC, which is lead counsel in a similar suit against Ik=on Office Solutions Inc., Malvern, Pa. The two law firms are representing M=s. Tittle with Campbell Harrison & Wright.=20The suits against Lucent and Ikon, like the suit against Enron, allege that= then-current plan trustees kept offering company stock in the plan despite= knowing of serious business problems that would hurt the stock price. Repr=esentatives for Ikon and Lucent say their companies didn t require employee=s to invest in the company stock, and educated employees about the need for= diversification.=20The suit in which Mr. Rinard is plaintiff notes that on Oct. 17, a day afte=r Enron announced the company was taking a nonrecurring charge totaling $1.=01 billion in the third quarter, Enron ""locked down"" the 401(k) plan s asse=ts, preventing participants from selling Enron shares. (A ""lock-down"" occur=s when a retirement plan is transferred from one administrator to another, =and generally lasts several weeks, during which time participants can t mak=e changes in their investment choices).=20The lock-down was lifted on Nov. 19. In the interim, on Nov. 8, Enron annou=nced it would be forced to restate downward its reported financial results =from 1997 through 2000. By the time the lock-down was lifted, as a result o=f all the negative news the shares had fallen to below $9 a share from $32.=20 on Oct. 17, when the lockup started, Hagens Berman attorney Karl Barth s=aid.=20""They were locked into it right when Enron knew it was going to be announci=ng some really bad news,"" Mr. Barth said. ""Mr. Rinard s looking at having n=o retirement savings now. It s a horrible thing to have to start over in yo=ur 50s.""...........................................................................=..........................................................=20Enron says sorry as shares keep falling.11/23/2001Energy Compass=20(c) 2001 Energy Intelligence Group. All rights reserved=20Investors in Enron must be wondering when their luck will change. The compa=ny s shares were sent tumbling again this week after the company revealed t=hat its credit crunch was worse than many investors thought. The news spurr=ed talk that rival energy trader Dynegy may have to inject more cash under =its plan to buy Enron - or could even walk away from the deal.=20In a quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Enron sa=id it must pay down a $690 million note by Nov. 27 because of the recent do=wngrade of its credit rating. Unless Enron repays the note or posts a lette=r of credit, the unidentified creditor can start liquidating Enron assets. =These include CEG Rio, a gas distribution company in Brazil that Enron is a=lready in the process of selling to pay down other debt.At the market close on Tuesday, Enron shares stood at $6.99/share, about 39=% below Dynegy s bid price of $11.60/share, and a fraction of the $90.75 pe=ak reached in August 2000 when the company was in its asset-light pomp.=20At least Enron is trying to say sorry - sort of. In a conference call with =analysts and investors last week, chairman and chief executive Kenneth Lay =indicated regret for the series of bad investments in non-core businesses t=hat has nearly bankrupted the big energy trading company. ""In hindsight, we= made some very bad investments in some non-core businesses,"" Lay acknowled=ged. ""I could not have ever contemplated the events we as a company and you= as a stakeholder have faced over the last several weeks. This has resulted= in a complete loss of investor confidence.""=20And, via the Dynegy deal, a complete loss of Enron independence, although e=ven that is not cut and dried. If Enron fails to settle the $690 million de=bt repayment next week, its credit rating would likely be reduced to sub-in=vestment or ""junk"" status. And if that happened, it would qualify as a ""mat=erial adverse change,"" allowing Dynegy to pull out of the merger if it want=ed to. Analysts doubt things will get this bad, still giving the deal a 70-=90% chance of going through............................................................................=..........................................................=20Business/Financial Desk; Section CFrom Sunbeam to Enron, Andersen s Reputation SuffersBy FLOYD NORRIS11/23/2001The New York Times=20Page 1, Column 2c. 2001 New York Times Company=20THIS has been the worst year ever for Arthur Andersen, the accounting firm =that once deserved the title of conscience of the industry. The Securities =and Exchange Commission filed civil fraud complaints against the Andersen p=artner who audited Sunbeam and against the firm itself in the Waste Managem=ent case.=20Now Enron has repudiated the financial statements that were certified by Ar=thur Andersen, in the process shaving more than half a billion dollars from= the company s reported profits in recent years.All of which raises the question: Has Arthur Andersen become the black shee=p of the accounting industry?=20It is not an easy question to answer, and not everyone is willing to rush t=o judgment.   If you want to attack Andersen for Enron, you need to know mo=re than we know,   Arthur Levitt, the former chairman of the Securities and= Exchange Commission, said this week.=20But if there is a thread connecting what is known about the three cases, it= is materiality. In all three cases, Andersen auditors spotted bad accounti=ng but were persuaded it was immaterial and therefore allowed it to go ahea=d.=20Materiality is one of those flexible concepts that can get accountants into= trouble. The idea is that it doesn t much matter if a few little things we=re gotten wrong. But they can add up.=20At Enron, however, they did not add up to that much -- a total of $93 milli=on over four years. The biggest restatement of Enron profits concerns a rel=ated party that Enron now says should have been consolidated. It is not cle=ar if Andersen had the facts needed to make that decision at the time.=20To those who treasure the role of auditors, the humiliation of Andersen is =painful. Back in the 1950 s, it was Leonard Spacek, Andersen s managing par=tner, who warned that   the profession s existence is in peril   because it= was not showing enough independence. His public prodding was crucial in ma=king the industry do a better job. Two decades ago, when the issue on the t=able was pension accounting, Andersen was the only major accounting firm to= break with clients and push for good rules.=20Now Andersen s backbone is open to question. It was evidence that senior pe=ople at Andersen repeatedly gave in to pressure from Waste Management that =led the S.E.C. to bring that suit, which the firm chose to settle without a=dmitting it had done anything wrong. The partner that the S.E.C. says looke=d the other way at Sunbeam is fighting the accusations, and Andersen says h=e acted properly.=20Lynn Turner, who was chief accountant of the S.E.C. at the time and is now =director of the Center for Quality Financial Reporting at Colorado State Un=iversity, says what is happening to Andersen now is reminiscent of what hap=pened to Coopers & Lybrand when he was a partner there and the firm had a s=eries of highly publicized blown audits.=20  We got bludgeoned to death in the press,   he said.   People did not even= want to see us at their doorsteps. It was brutal, but we deserved it. We h=ad gotten into this mentality in the firm of making business judgment calls=.   By that he meant that the firm paid too much attention to not offending= clients and not enough to good accounting.=20For Andersen to avoid that fate, its relatively new chief executive, Joseph= Berardino, who declined to be interviewed for this column, will need to se=t a tone inside the firm making clear that he expects auditors to show the =backbone that Mr. Spacek epitomized. And then he will have to convince the =public of that............................................................................=..........................................................=20Dynegy Deal To Buy Enron Hits CrossroadsBy Rebecca Smith and John R. EmshwillerStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal11/23/2001The Wall Street Journal=20A3(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)=20Even as it reiterated its intention to purchase Enron Corp., Dynegy Inc. is= coming under increasing pressure to renegotiate or walk away from the mult=ibillion-dollar deal.=20The pressure is stemming from the continuing slide in the price of Enron sh=ares and the mounting financial problems at the Houston energy-trading comp=any, the nation s biggest marketer of electricity and natural gas. During t=he past month, Enron has taken a $1 billion write-off of assets, revised do=wnward the earnings of the past several years and taken a $1.2 billion redu=ction in shareholder equity.The problems have been due largely to dealings Enron had with private partn=erships, run by some of its own executives, under investigation by the Secu=rities and Exchange Commission. In an SEC filing Monday, Enron disclosed hu=ndreds of millions of potential additional write-offs as well as the possib=ility that its weakening financial condition could force it to repay more t=han $2 billion in loans by the end of the year.=20As of 4 p.m. Wednesday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron =shares fell $1.98, or 28%, to $5.01 each after having dropped 23% Tuesday. =In excess of 115 million shares traded Wednesday, more than four times the =volume of any other Big Board stock. Enron s bonds also again traded sharpl=y lower, market observers said.=20The turmoil spilled over to Dynegy s stock, which also was among the most a=ctively traded on the New York Stock Exchange. As of 4 p.m. Wednesday, Dyne=gy shares fell $1.94 to $39.76 each.=20On Wednesday, Dynegy issued a statement in which Chairman and Chief Executi=ve Chuck Watson said his company was working ""to accelerate the regulatory =approvals required to complete the merger in accordance with the previously= announced agreement"" though it continued to perform ""due diligence"" on Enr=on.=20Under the merger agreement, Dynegy has opportunities to renegotiate or walk= away from the deal if Enron s financial and legal problems become severe e=nough. However, some observers said it can be difficult to invoke these so-=called material adverse change clauses. They point to a decision earlier th=is year by a Delaware Chancery Court judge who forced Tyson Foods Inc. to c=omplete a planned purchase of IBP Inc. even though Tyson, a Springdale, Ark=., food-products company, had wanted to cancel the transaction because of a= drop in IBP s earnings and accounting problems at an IBP unit.=20Dynegy officials didn t return calls seeking comment. To complete the deal,= two-thirds of Dynegy shareholders and a majority of Enron shareholders wou=ld have to give their approval. No dates for those votes have been set.=20One person familiar with the merger plans said the SEC filing Monday by Enr=on contained information Dynegy hadn t known about. Dynegy representatives =planned to work through the weekend evaluating the importance of this new i=nformation as part of the company s due diligence, this person said. It cou=ldn t be determined what the new information was.=20The merger agreement, announced Nov. 9, calls for Dynegy to exchange 0.2685= share for each of Enron s roughly 850 million fully diluted shares, giving= the purchase a value of about $9 billion at Dynegy s current stock price. =However, from a price standpoint, the deal is appearing less attractive to =Dynegy.=20On the day of the merger announcement, Enron shares were trading at about $=8.63 each, or about 83% of the purchase price under the exchange ratio. As =of Wednesday, Enron s market price was only about 47% of the merger-formula= price. Such a sharp deterioration is unusual following a merger announceme=nt, when the stock price of the company being acquired generally begins tra=ding relatively close to the offering price.=20Sentiment among Wall Street analysts also is turning against the merger. In=itially, many analysts lauded the merger as a move that would rescue Enron =and provide a major boost to Houston-based Dynegy. Dynegy and Enron officia=ls have predicted that the merger, supposed to be completed late next year,= would significantly and immediately increase Dynegy s earnings.=20Now analysts are challenging that assumption. Ron Barone, managing director= at UBS Warburg LLC, said he believes that because of Enron s financial pro=blems, a combined company would actually have lower earnings next year than= Dynegy would have by itself. Mr. Barone said he thinks a ""likely scenario""= is that the merger formula will be renegotiated sharply down to about 0.15= Dynegy share for each Enron share.=20Such a ratcheting down wouldn t be without precedent in the deal. According= to one person familiar with the merger negotiations, Dynegy reduced the ex=change formula at least once prior to the Nov. 9 announcement because of En=ron s rapidly sinking stock price, which at the beginning of this year was =above $80 a share.=20In perhaps the most significant sign of the turning tide on Wall Street, Go=ldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer lowered his ratings on Enron and Dynegy=. A longtime Enron fan, Mr. Fleischer issued a report expressing doubts tha=t the merger would help Dynegy s earnings and whether Enron could ""recover =the significant business that has been lost"" in its giant energy-trading op=erations. ""The Enron machine continues to sputter,"" Mr. Fleischer wrote.=20Some observers say that if Dynegy walked away from the deal or tried to ren=egotiate the terms significantly, Enron might be pushed into a bankruptcy-l=aw filing. Without the Dynegy acquisition and continued support from its ba=nkers and customers, an Enron bankruptcy-court filing ""is highly possible,""= said Ralph Pellecchia, a senior director at Fitch, a credit-ratings agency=. On Wednesday, Fitch maintained its credit rating on Enron at just one not=ch above noninvestment-grade, or ""junk,"" status. But Fitch also said it bel=ieved Enron s trading partners had made ""significant cash collateral calls""= in recent days that are ""well in excess of previous expectations,"" contrib=uting to ""liquidity pressures.""=20Among the advisers Enron has hired during its current crisis is the law fir=m of Weil, Gotshal & Manges, which specializes in bankruptcy and corporate-=workout situations. Asked about a possible bankruptcy filing, an Enron spok=eswoman said the company expects the Dynegy deal to go through and therefor=e doesn t expect to have to look at alternatives to the merger. Since the m=erger announcement, Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay has said his company had alt=ernatives to the Dynegy deal but he has declined to identify them. Enron sa=id it made some progress improving its financial position. The company said= it reached a final agreement with units of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Cit=igroup Inc. on the remaining $450 million of a previously announced $1 bill=ion in secured credit lines. Enron said lenders had agreed to extend repaym=ent of an existing $690 million note to mid-December from next week. The sp=okeswoman said a restructuring of that obligation is expected to be complet=ed next month so that repayment wouldn t be required this year.=20---=20Thaddeus Herrick and Robin Sidel contributed to this article............................................................................=..........................................................=20Options ReportPremiums Stay High on Enron s Near Options, And `Doubling Up  Date Looms fo=r Tax LossesBy Kopin TanDow Jones Newswires11/23/2001The Wall Street Journal=20C11(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)=20NEW YORK -- Volatility and premiums on Enron s near-month options remain ex=tremely high. It is a sign that investors are willing to pay a rich price f=or option protection and expect the stock to be unsettled as the Houston co=mpany sorts through its credit and debt problems and seeks to calm frazzled= investors.=20Enron near-month defensive puts traded heavily in an otherwise quiet sessio=n Wednesday, as investors bought them to hedge. The December 5 puts traded =more than 10,000 contracts and jumped 45 cents to $1.10 at the Chicago Boar=d Options Exchange. The stock closed down $1.98, or 28%, to $5.01, as of 4 =p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.Enron s calls traded actively as some investors sold them to generate incom=e. Traders noted some call buying -- especially after Enron procured a thre=e-week extension on a $690 million note -- as some hopeful investors bet on= Enron pulling through its troubles and proceeding with its merger with Dyn=egy Inc. Enron s December 5 calls traded more than 14,500 contracts, compar=ed with open interest of 710, as they fell $1.45 to $1.15 at the CBOE.=20For investors who want to book a tax loss on beaten-down stocks, the ""wash =sale"" rule can be a hurdle, because it essentially prevents taxpayers from =selling stock or securities at a loss and then reacquiring ""substantially i=dentical"" securities within a 30-day period before or after that loss. This= poses a problem for those who want to book a loss yet own stocks whose pri=ces now make them attractive ""buy"" candidates.=20In addition, the Internal Revenue Service has taken the position that the w=ash-sale rule will disallow a loss if the investor sells an in-the-money pu=t, because there is a strong likelihood that stock will be put to or acquir=ed by the investor.=20So investors typically get around the wash-sale rule by ""doubling up"": buyi=ng additional stock or options, waiting at least 31 days, and then selling =the original stock to book the loss. Investors double up by buying calls, w=hich locks a price to buy stock and achieves the same effect as buying addi=tional stock............................................................................=..........................................................=20INDIA PRESS: Enron May Sell Dabhol Stake For $500 Mln11/22/2001Dow Jones International News=20(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)=20NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp.

I think of these words often and believe them more than ever, particularly after the events, both external and internal to Enron, of the last few months.  I do not know for sure what the next few weeks or months will bring for any of us, but I do know that what we ve done here at Enron in Government Affairs over the last several years, whether in Houston, Washington, London, Brussels, Sao Paulo, etc. was very good and will be remembered for the positive difference that we have all made in the industries in which we have worked and for each other.  We even had a good time doing it.  The good work we do will go on for many, if not, all of us . . . for some, here; for others, elsewhere.  Regardless of what the future holds, we should all be quite proud of what we have accomplished here and how it has been accomplished.  My personal appreciation for all that you have done as well as at having had the opportunity to be part of a group that, unfortunately, will be inalterably impacted and changed over the next few weeks, is boundless.

118772,2001-11-20 14:22:59,"How about this...There was no recognizable change in counterparties.  No one significant has dropped off.  We can t identify individuals who might not be transacting with us.  The transaction volume is still within the normal range, given the normal daily and counterparty variability (30-day rolling average of more than 5,500 transactions with a notional value of more than $2.7 billion).  As reported in the 10Q, while trading volumes in our core natural gas and power business have held steady, there has been some decrease in wholesale trading volumes in a few of our non-core businesses.  Additionally, due to the unusual events of the last few weeks, we have seen some decrease in the number of long-term transactions.

Last week a couple of heavy hitters left money on= the table.=20Mark McGwire, the home-run-hitting baseball player for St. Louis, retired. =And he let it be known that he never signed a two-year, $30 million contrac=t his agent negotiated last spring. Why? Because he wanted to find out if h=is injured right knee would allow him to play as well as he had before. It =didn t, and he decided he wasn t worth that kind of money.Then Ken Lay, chairman of Enron Corp., said he won t take the $60.6 million= he had coming to him in a severance agreement that comes into play when En=ron is sold to Dynegy Corp.=20Of course, neither McGwire nor Lay will ever have to consider my fallback r=etirement plan - sacking groceries at the supermarket, carrying them to the= car and hoping for a big tip. Still, it was a class act on both their part=s. McGwire only hit .187 last season, well below his lifetime average. And =Lay? Well, let s say that rarely in the history of American capitalism has =a company sunk as fast as Enron.=20Remember that earlier this year its stock hit a top of $82 a share. Now it =s hovering in the single-digit level, and Enron is being forced to sell its=elf to a smaller rival.=20The stock price incentive=20How did Enron get into this position? Put the blame on the company s relent=less drive to push up its stock price. And a big reason for that push comes= from the way American companies compensate top executives.=20In the last couple of decades, executive compensation has soared. The avera=ge chief executive officer today makes 531 times as much in salary, bonuses= and stock options as the average factory worker.=20Apologists for executive pay say these kinds of figures really aren t relev=ant. Most of the money top executives receive doesn t come from base pay or= bonuses but from stock options.=20Such options usually work this way. Executives are given hundreds or thousa=nds of shares of stock that they can only buy from the company at a future =date. The sales price can be anything from 10 cents to the price of the sto=ck on the date the options were granted. If the stock increases past the ex=ercise price in the option, the executive can buy the stock and then sell i=t, making big bucks. It the stock has dropped below the option price - it s= underwater, in the jargon - then those options are worthless.=20Granting options aligns the interests of the top executives with the shareh=olders, those who favor this sort of incentive say. And that s true, if you= talking about in-and-out traders. But it s not true if we re looking out f=or the interests of the majority who hold stocks for the long term.=20Keeping the debt hidden=20Keeping its stock price soaring was what brought down Enron.=20To hype the stock, Enron s execs were hiding the debt it took on to fuel it=s amazing growth and some of its dicier investments, in partnerships. Enron= was supposedly only a minority partner in these deals. That way it could m=ove a large portion of its debt off its books in that partnership. That, in= turn, made the company s earnings look better.=20When Enron s executives finally fessed up, they had to write down their pro=fits over the past few years by 20 percent. But the real irony here is that= 80 percent is still a heck of a lot of money. But by that time, the majori=ty of shareholders simply had no faith in Enron s bookkeeping.=20Now look at Lay s compensation. In 1999 he exercised stock options and made= $44 million on them. In 2000, sales of options brought him $123 million, a=nd this year about $26 million, according to a study published by Bloomberg= News.=20Was Lay deliberating deceiving investors to keep his stock options profitab=le? I don t think so. He was simply following the latest fad in corporate g=overnance. He was aligning himself with the interests of the shareholders.==20The shareholders were happy with that high stock price. Nobody - besides so=me stock analysts - complained about Enron s often- impenetrable bookkeepin=g until that stock price started to fall.=20Would Enron s bookkeeping have been different if top executives received fe=wer stock options? Maybe.=20Fewer stock options would mean lower pay for the top guys. And no one would= want that job if he were only going to make $10 million a year instead of =$100 million.=20Just kidding.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

ROSEN11/18/2001The New York TimesPage 8, Column 2c. 2001 New York Times CompanyDESPITE last week s plunge in the price of crude oil and in shares of big o=il companies, some Wall Street analysts remain upbeat about the long-term p=rospects for energy stocks.=20  These very dramatic downturns are great buying opportunities,   said Tina= Vital, an oil and gas analyst at Standard & Poor s, who recommends a broad= group of integrated oil companies, including Exxon Mobil, ChevronTexaco, R=oyal Dutch/Shell, BP and TotalFinaElf.   They have excellent management, a =top dividend yield and are a safe haven for investors,   she said, provided= that investors are patient and can bear short-term swings.Last week s price declines were set off by Russian oil companies  refusal t=o accept demands by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries f=or big production cuts. They were a reminder that the sector is extremely v=olatile.   Oil could go to $10 a barrel short term,   she said, but there i=s no certainty of that. The oil producers could reach an agreement by Janua=ry, sending prices upward. Over the long term, she expects to see productio=n cuts.=20Demand for energy has grown only 0.5 percent this year, and prices have bee=n declining for some time for both crude oil and gasoline -- as drivers hav=e seen at the gas pump. West Texas intermediate crude closed Friday at $18.=03 on the New York Mercantile Exchange, up 58 cents from its Thursday close=, the lowest since June 1999. But an economic recovery, expected by late 20=02, could cause demand to pick up, analysts say.=20As oil prices have dropped, so have the prices of most oil stocks, but not =as much as the overall market since the beginning of 2000. Over that period=, the S.& P. energy index has lost 8 percent, while the S.& P. 500-stock in=dex is down 23 percent.=20A report issued last week by the Energy Department said that while the Sept=. 11 terrorist attacks had intensified the country s economic slowdown,   t=hey are not expected to result in any long-term volatility in energy market=s.   The report estimated that commercial energy demand would rise 1.7 perc=ent a year through 2020, instead of the 1.2 percent predicted only a year a=go. Its predictions assume increased use of computers and office equipment,= and slower increases in fuel efficiency for cars and trucks.=20WHILE they warn of the possibility of wild price shifts in the months ahead=, other analysts are similarly bullish for the long term. L. Bruce Lanni, s=enior oil analyst at A. G. Edwards & Sons in New York, said that any potent=ial price war was likely to be fairly short-lived, because neither OPEC nor= non-OPEC countries could   withstand low oil prices for a prolonged period= of time,   and prices should rebound sharply as a result,   back up in the= lower to mid-$20 range.  =20Low prices could be painful for most of the oil companies in the short term=, but Mr. Lanni, too, sees value in the stocks.=20His top pick is Conoco, now trading at $24.30; his 12-month target is $34. =  We remain confident,   he said,   that the company s annual oil and gas p=roduction should grow by about 4 percent, on average, over the next several= years.  =20Conoco s debt, at 55 percent of capital, is relatively high, but he expects= the company s strong cash flow -- it equaled $5.33 a share last year -- to= reduce the debt level to 46 percent next year and to 38 percent in 2003. T=he company s after-tax interest cost is only 3.5 percent, he said.=20Mr. Lanni also favors Kerr-McGee, a natural gas exploration and production =company, and BP, calling both undervalued. He regards Exxon Mobil, Royal Du=tch/Shell and ChevronTexaco as fully priced, so he is not recommending buyi=ng them now.   If you own them, hold them,   he said.=20William Featherston, executive director and an oil and gas exploration anal=yst at UBS Warburg, said he felt   near-term caution but medium-term optimi=sm for sustainably higher   natural gas prices. He said he would encourage =investors to consider buying shares of exploration and production companies= over the next two months. His top picks are Apache, Kerr-McGee and EOG Res=ources.=20Such stocks are highly volatile, he said. They are   trading-oriented vehic=les, and short-term volatility in commodity prices generally provides the m=ost attractive entry and exit points,   he said.   While natural gas prices= declined throughout most of this year, prices rose at a startling pace, fr=om $1.75 per million cubic feet at the end of September to over $3 per mill=ion cubic feet within weeks.  =20He cited three reasons for the price rally: a decline in gas surpluses, pre=dictions of a colder-than-normal winter and what he has called   pathetic t=hird-quarter natural gas production,   despite record drilling activity.=20The tangled finances of the Enron Corporation were also a factor in the rec=ent price increase for natural gas futures, he said. Enron, which marketed =25 billion cubic feet a day of natural gas, or more than 40 percent of the =nation s demand, is under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Comm=ission and announced a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity from de=als with partnerships involving its former chief financial officer. It also= reported a third-quarter loss and restated earlier earnings. Enron has agr=eed to be taken over by Dynegy, a smaller rival, for about $9 billion in st=ock. Dynegy is also assuming about $13 billion in debt.=20Anxiety over whether the Enron investigation would disrupt deliveries or ha=ve other market repercussions led to an increase in prices. While it is   d=ifficult to quantify the Enron factor,   Mr. Featherston said, the short-te=rm effects on natural gas prices seem to be over.=20OTHER factors, of course, could also mean a bumpy ride for energy investors= over the next several months. The status of the war against terrorism, Pre=sident Bush s decision to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, thus helpin=g OPEC in reducing excess global capacity, and a United Nations review of t=he food-for-oil deal with Iraq expected in December could each have a signi=ficant impact on battered oil prices.=20Nevertheless, Ms. Vital said, for the long term, energy will probably be in= short supply, and new sources must be developed. So she also likes the pro=spects of two drilling companies, Noble Drilling and Nabors Industries. Bot=h took a beating last week, along with the oil companies, so again she sees= buying opportunities.=20Bern Fleming, portfolio manager of the AXP Utilities Income fund in Minneap=olis, who has stakes in Dynegy, Duke Energy and Dominion Resources, said al=l three had good prospects for growth, thanks to a mix of assets,   managem=ent I respect and solid business plans.

Aquila said it began making contingency plans in case Dynegywithdrew from its $24 billion takeover of Enron, the paperreported.     Enron, the largest energy trader, decided to sell after itsshares plunged this year and a federal investigation of accountingirregularities limited its ability to finance operations. Enron scollapse would have caused upheaval in energy markets, where thecompany does one-quarter of all gas and power trades.     Dynegy s agreement to buy Enron allows it to withdraw fromthe transaction under certain circumstances, the FT said.PERSPECTIVESA tale of greed and hubrisWaldo Proffitt11/18/2001Sarasota Herald-TribuneAllF2(Copyright 2001)For anyone not already disenchanted with the idea of total deregulation of =public utilities, the most recent installment of the miserable Enron story =as it unfolded last week should serve as a convincing example of the folly =of relying on unregulated profit- driven enterprises to supply our energy.==20A year ago Enron was the darling of Wall Street, the poster boy for the uti=lity industry, its stock selling for about $85 a share. Last week its stock= was worth about 10 percent of that and the company had agreed to be bought= by a competitor. There was fear the company s bond rating might fall to th=e ""junk"" level.What happened? It will take months, if not years, to untangle the details, =but it is clear that the main culprit was greed, closely followed by hubris=.=20Not too many years ago Enron was a small, struggling, gas pipeline company =in Houston. As deregulation spread to more and more states, Enron began acq=uiring pipelines, gas producers and utilities.=20It also acquired friends in high places, especially the Bush family and the=ir key political advisers. And, it discovered it could make money faster by= selling and trading energy than by producing it. Enron sold many of its ge=nerating plants and became the biggest ""power broker"" in the nation.=20Though it was by no means the largest winner in the con game that bilked Ca=lifornia consumers of tens of billions of dollars, Enron was one of the fir=st power barons to take advantage of California s flawed deregulation law -=- virtually written by in-state and out-of- state utility companies.=20The California fiasco soured (probably) most Americans on utility deregulat=ion, but Enron was not singled out for calumny, and management saw no reaso=n to examine its business ethics.=20Contrarywise. management had visions of even greater profits, which it felt= no obligation to share with ordinary stockholders. The chief financial off=icer and other high-ranking executives set up affiliated or subsidiary part=nerships which made deals with Enron. I do not understand the details of th=ese arrangements, but neither do independent accountants, the Securities an=d Exchange Commission or congressional investigators. It does seem clear th=at the Enron insiders made millions for themselves.=20Enron acknowledges, without explaining, that stockholder equity dropped $1.=2 billion in the last quarter and that it had for the last five years overs=tated profits by some $600 million. Whether this was by design or by mistak=e is in dispute, but it is the sort of thing which tends to undermine the c=onfidence of investors.=20So much for greed. Back to hubris. It seems not unlikely that Enron s leade=rs felt they might not be punished for a modest amount of corner-cutting be=cause they had friends in high places.=20The chief executive, Kenneth L. Lay, was and is a personal friend of George= W. Bush and has easy access to the White House. For many months after the =new administration took office, Karl Rove, Bush s top political strategist,= owned Enron stock valued at $100,000 to $250,000, and sold it only after h=e had been able to secure a ruling that he did not have to pay capital gain=s tax immediately because he sold to avoid a conflict of interest. Lawrence= Lindsey, the president s chief economic coordinator, and I. Lewis Libby, V=ice President Cheney s chief of staff, owned stock in Enron, and Lindsey wa=s paid $50,000 last year as a consultant for Enron.=20Enron and its employees gave more than anyone else to Bush s four political= campaigns -- one (unsuccessful) for Congress, two for governor and one for= president. In 2000, Enron and its employees gave $113,000 to Bush s campai=gn, $250,000 to the Republican National Committee, and $300,000 to the Pres=idential Inauguration Committee.=20Cabinet appointments affecting energy policy, key sub-Cabinet appointments,= administration action or inaction in the California energy mess, and the o=verall energy policy of the administration could hardly have been more favo=rable to the interests of Enron.=20And now a couple of questions: Is it possible the unusual financial maneuve=rs by Enron went unnoticed or even unsuspected by all the savvy Texas oilme=n in the Bush administration? Were those of them with heavy investments in =Enron unconcerned about the conduct of the company? Was Enron right in thin=king its friends in government would not be in a hurry to investigate or to= reprimand?=20Or, in light of our preoccupation with terrorism, will the Enron case get m=uch attention from the federal government? Or from voters?=20Waldo Proffitt is the former editor of the Herald-Tribune.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

""=20Many Americans, contemplating the losses they ve suffered this year in the =stock market, might say there was nothing ""best"" about what happened to the=m--in fact, nothing good at all, perhaps other than that it might have been= worse.With share prices on the rise again, the damage to portfolios has been less=ened. Even so, stocks will have to post strong gains in the next six weeks =to keep this from being the market s worst calendar year since 1977.=20The blue-chip Standard & Poor s 500 index rose 1.6% last week, but it s sti=ll down 13.8% year to date.=20Yet those losses, while certainly not trivial (especially when they re your=s), can obscure what arguably are some very positive aspects of this year s= experiences.=20With investing, adversity can be a more important teacher than success. If =you re having trouble this Thanksgiving week finding reasons to be thankful= about anything investment-related, try these on for size:=20* ""Asset allocation"" is no longer just a quaint theory. The paramount inves=ting rule has always been to spread your money around to reduce risk. But i=t took the worst stock bear market in 25 years to bring this lesson home fo=r many people who thought equities only rose in value.=20Now, millions of investors have a far better appreciation for just how much= they can lose in stocks--and how bonds and short-term cash savings can off=set market losses and preserve capital.=20It has been a hard lesson, to be sure. But investors who take asset allocat=ion to heart will be laying a much more solid foundation for their money in= the long run. And don t underestimate what that can mean for your peace of= mind long term.=20* The wisdom of saving money on a regular basis has been relearned. In the =late 1990s, many economists lamented how the U.S. savings rate continued to= shrink. Some people felt there was little need to put significant new sums= into savings when the stocks or stock mutual funds they owned seemed to be= rising nonstop.=20In other words, many Americans were letting the stock market do their savin=g for them when share prices were rising 20% or more each year.=20Now, with shares down and with the likelihood of much more moderate returns= on stocks in this decade, it s clear that many people will have to find a =way to save regularly if they re going to meet their long-term financial go=als, especially retirement.=20This may not be a pleasant reality, but it s better for most people to have= faced this fact sooner rather than later, while there may be time to make =up lost ground.=20* A healthy skepticism has replaced mindless euphoria about stocks and thos=e who tout them. The market s slide has discredited a legion of Wall Street= analysts, money managers and others whose knowledge, understanding and jud=gment were clearly lacking, in retrospect.=20Investors have come to see that having blind faith in those who present the=mselves as ""experts"" is a highly dangerous strategy, if it can be called a =strategy at all.=20Sure, it may have been more fun when technology stocks were shooting the mo=on and nobody had much use for reviewing a company s fundamentals. But that= wasn t investing--it was speculating, and on a massive, and ultimately rui=nous, scale.=20People have learned to be less trusting about what others say about the mar=ket, and that is more likely to be beneficial than detrimental to their por=tfolios in the long run.=20Just ask anyone who shifted their entire 401(k) retirement savings sum into= aggressive-growth mutual funds in the first quarter of 2000--right before =the market peaked--because of the bullish comments of some 25-year-old tech= stock analyst. Those investors aren t likely to make a move like that agai=n.=20* Free-market forces are weeding out the weak players and the phonies. Capi=talism may be harsh, but it s efficient when the good times end and it s ti=me to find out which companies truly have talent and staying power--and des=erve more capital.=20Hundreds of dot-coms have failed, but who really misses them? Is it any har=der to find what you want on the Internet? It probably would have been much= worse for all concerned if those companies had sucked up investors  funds =for another year instead of failing when they did.=20But the market isn t just eliminating small companies that never had much o=f a future. The financial near-collapse of energy giant Enron Corp. exposed= a business that twisted accounting rules to its own benefit--to the point =that the company now concedes that financial statements all the way back to= 1997 ""should not be relied upon.""=20Also to be weeded out, though over a longer time period, will be mutual fun=d managers whose performance running other peoples  money has been a nightm=are for those investors--meaning, the returns produced have been far worse =than what the investors would have achieved in the average fund in that par=ticular sector.=20These managers know who they are--and, hopefully, their shareholders know b=y now as well, and will vote with their feet.=20The free market also is reminding cartels just how tough it is to control p=rices.=20Once again, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has lost its =ability to prop up crude oil prices, which have sunk to two-year lows amid =the weak global economy. That s lousy for OPEC, but it s great for every en=ergy consumer.=20* The market s woes have altered many investors  priorities for the better.= The wild bull market of the late 1990s demanded peoples  attention, and go=t it.=20For some, stocks became an obsession. Their portfolios dominated their live=s, especially if they were actively trading shares. They believed they were= going to be rich, or richer, and that it was all because of how smart they= were.=20Now, most people have been humbled by the market.

A portfolio that increases in pr=ice by 10 percent each and every year is worth exactly the same at the end =of three years as a portfolio that falls by half the first year, rises by t=hree-quarters the second and rises by 52 percent the third. But reasonable =investors prefer the consistent ride. It prevents them from doing something= stupid, such as selling all their stocks after losing half their money dur=ing that first disastrous year.=20Consider the sad case of James D. McCall, who earlier this month resigned a=s manager of the Merrill Lynch Focus Twenty mutual fund. Two years ago, Mer=rill wanted McCall s services so desperately that the firm went to court to= pry McCall away from his previous employer, Pilgrim Baxter, where he rang =up impressive gains in the late 1990s. (His big success was called PBHG Lar=ge Cap 20.) And when they got McCall, Merrill s brokers raised more than $1=.5 billion from their clients for him to invest. While the average growth-s=tock mutual fund owns about 100 stocks, with the top 10 holdings representi=ng about one-fourth of the portfolio s total value, McCall specialized in w=hat are called ""concentrated portfolios."" In the case of Merrill Lynch Focu=s Twenty, he owned, as the name implies, just 20 stocks. At last report, hi=s top 10 holdings accounted for a whopping two-thirds of the fund s assets.==20If McCall had spread his 20 stocks among, say, a dozen different industries=, he might have smoothed his ride. Instead, 69 percent of his assets went t=o technology firms. The Focus fund and a smaller one that McCall ran called= Premier Growth were launched in March 2000. Within just 17 months, all but= $650 million of the clients  original $1.5 billion had vanished.=20It is hard to imagine losing as much as Focus Twenty did even if you tried.= As of Nov. 9, the week McCall resigned, the fund was down 72 percent for t=he year, compared with a loss of 14 percent for the Standard & Poor s 500-s=tock index, the benchmark for fund managers. According to the latest report= from Morningstar Mutual Funds, 19 of McCall s 20 stocks had declined durin=g 2001, the only exception being Harley-Davidson. More amazing, 16 of the 1=9 losers had fallen by at least half. (By the way, Enron was McCall s seven=th-largest holding.)=20""This fund has had a wretched existence,"" wrote Morningstar analyst Kunal K=apoor, who did admit a grudging admiration for McCall s perseverance. McCal=l s ""faith may turn out to be well placed over time,"" Kapoor said. Unfortun=ately, time ran out.=20My point here is not to pick on McCall but to reveal the perils of concentr=ation. Buying Focus Twenty as a technology fund, and consigning it to no mo=re than one-fifth of your holdings (with the rest of your assets in diversi=fied, conventional stocks or funds) might have made sense, but Focus Twenty= was touted as a ""long-term capital appreciation"" fund, not a sector fund. =Here, it failed, but maybe it didn t have to.=20The manager who made the concentrated fund popular, Tom Marsico, who ran Ja=nus Twenty, took care to spread his holdings around. His successor, Scott S=choelzel, has suffered losses lately (he is down 28 percent year-to-date, b=ut that s after a total gain of 546 percent in the preceding five years), b=ut they have not been nearly so catastrophic -- and for good reason. Schoel=zel s last report lists among his top 10 holdings three tech stocks, two fi=nancials, one drug company, one energy firm (whoops, Enron again), one indu=strial, one consumer-durables company and one services firm.=20For investors in individual stocks, the important question is this: How muc=h diversification is enough? Some risk is inherent in even the broadest por=tfolio. This is called market, or ""systematic,"" risk. Over the past 75 year=s, market risk, as measured in standard deviation, has been about 20 percen=t. In other words, in two-thirds of the years the annual return of the S&P =has fallen into a band ranging from 20 points lower to 20 points higher tha=n its average return of 11 percent; that is, between a loss of 9 percent an=d a gain of 31 percent. That s still volatile, but if you invest in stocks =you have to live with it.=20What you don t have to live with is anything more volatile. So your objecti=ve in building a portfolio is to try to approximate systematic risk and avo=id what is called ""idiosyncratic,"" or extra, risk. A portfolio with just a =few stocks, or one like McCall s, that is overloaded in a single sector, ha=s lots of idiosyncratic risk. In 1977, an influential study found that inve=stors could nearly eliminate that extra risk by owning just 20 stocks in a =wide variety of sectors; in fact, owning eight or 10 stocks depressed risk =sharply.=20Recently, however, the market has appeared to be far more volatile, and a n=ew study by a group of economists headed by John Campbell of Harvard found =that many more stocks were needed -- around 50 -- to bring a portfolio down= to the same level of riskiness as the broad market. What Campbell s group =found was that neither the market itself nor individual sectors had become =more volatile in the 1990s, but that stocks within those sectors had, so yo=u need to own more of them.=20But owning 50 stocks is a pain in the neck -- and it brings up the Buffett-=Lynch admonitions about too much diversification. It is hard just to take t=he time to make the selections, but even buy-and-hold investors need to kee=p track of the companies they own to spot adverse changes in management, pr=oduct failures or new competition (not to mention Enron-style accounting sh=enanigans) -- signs that it s time to sell.=20One good answer is to achieve balance by owning a combination of mutual fun=ds and stocks. For example, you might want to put 50 percent of the money y=ou have allotted for stocks into a fund that mimics the S&P itself, like Va=nguard Index 500, which charges rock-bottom expenses and guarantees that ri=sk won t exceed systematic levels. You could also consider a broad fund tha=t s managed by human beings, such as Meridian Value or Baron Growth, which =are recommended by Sheldon Jacobs, editor of the No-Load Fund Investor news=letter. Then another 25 percent of your holdings can go into a few sector f=unds that specialize in technology, real estate, energy and small-caps, and= the final 25 percent into a portfolio of 10 to 20 individual stocks. (I ow=n 16, at last count.)=20There are many valid variations. Just don t emulate Mark Twain.=20In a letter to clients recently, Anthony M. Maramarco of David L. Babson & =Co., the Cambridge, Mass., investment firm, recalled the aphorism of Twain =s Pudd n head Wilson: ""Put all your eggs in the one basket -- and watch tha=t basket!"" Unfortunately, such a philosophy emphatically does not work in s=tock investing -- as Twain himself learned when he sank nearly all his fort=une into the Paige Linotype, a machine that flopped.=20We all make mistakes. (It was Twain, after all, who pointed out that ""human= beings are the only animals that blush -- or need to."") But smart diversif=ication helps investors avoid some of the worst of them.=20James K.

All Rights ReservedFINANCE WEEK - From dealing to reeling - The legacy of the late 1990s stock= market bubble remains with us, as does irrationality THE LONG VIEW - BARRY= RILEY.=20Optimism is back. Stock markets around the globe have typically rallied by =20 per cent since rock bottom was reached on September 21. Only 9 per cent =of global fund managers believe equities will be lower in 12 months, accord=ing to a Merrill Lynch survey published this week.But the legacy of the late 1990s stock market bubble remains with us. The c=hallenge is how to minimise the level of irrationality. Two of the UK s big=gest losers from crazy prices reported on Tuesday. Vodafone suffered #11.45=bn of write-downs - but curiously, made no provisions against the sky-high =#13.1bn it paid for third-generation mobile phone licences in 2000.=20Such payments, argued Sir Christopher Gent, Voda-fone s chief executive, we=re merely what the market demanded at the time. It is interesting to note, =too, that Paul Klemperer, the Oxford professor who is an expert in ""auction= theory"" and advised the British government, has defended the disastrous ou=tcome by arguing that the prices reflected the capital market s view of 3G =s prospects. The common theme here is that it is nobody s fault if crazy pr=ices are paid, because they are legitimised by the stock market.=20Marconi, which is financially in a much worse state than the mobile phone g=iant, has written off most of the #4.1bn paid for US internet hardware comp=anies in 1999. There has also been a great deal of controversy in the US du=ring the past few weeks over the near-collapse of Enron, the power group be=ing rescued by a takeover bid from its smaller rival Dynegy. There was an o=bvious failure by investors - and by stock market analysts - to assess the =true risks at Enron.=20Smart businessmen will sellat mad prices, but why on earth should they buy?= The trouble is, too many academics have developed theories of value based =on rational expectations. The real world is unfortunately very different.==20Some of the distortions had obvious technical origins. The Vodafone bubble =of 1999 reflected the cross-border takeover of Mannesmann and the artificia=l weighting shortages that developed from that transaction as Vodafone ball=ooned in market capitalisation to reach, at one stage, 16 per cent of the F=TSE 100 Index. The market price was driven not by normal corporate fundamen=tals, but by the desire of most fund managers to reach a market weighting, =at which point they were ""safe"" in terms of risk against the index benchmar=k.=20That was the period when investment banks exploited the idea of low free-fl=oat new issues: internet companies, especially, were floated off with only =15 per cent of the stock made available, although anything up to 100 per ce=nt went into the indices, creating serious shortages and bubble valuations.= Changes now being made to the main stock market indices have reduced the p=roblem, but there remains a basic irrationality in the concept that investm=ent risk resides in an index rather than in the underlying stocks.=20Takeovers have always been plagued by irrationality, and indeed this is an =area where academics recognise the problem; over many years they have point=ed out that all the benefits of deals, and often more than all, accrue to t=he shareholders of the companies taken over, while investors in the bidding= companies suffer dilution. Investors know this, and in normal market condi=tions news of a takeover will depress the bidder s share price. But in a bu=bble market these prudent attitudes can be overwhelmed by euphoria, as well= as technical factors relating to demand by fund managers so that they can =maintain their weightings when a bidder is spraying around large quantities= of new equity.=20Also, it is irrational that many more deals are done when the stock market =is high than when it is low. Two years ago, companies such as Marconi were =engaged in buying sprees at daft prices. Now, when prices are much lower, h=ardly any acquisitions are being made (and investment banks are dismissing =thousands of employees). An exception to the deal famine is gold mining, wh=ich just happens to have been one of the stock market s strongest sectors t=his year.=20Another important source of irrationality has been the domination of stock =market analysis by the stockbroking offshoots of the investment banks. Over= recent years their earnings-per-share forecasts for the next calendar year= have been on average 8 per cent too high. This has not just been a mistake=; they have been paid to be over-optimistic. Admittedly, attempts are being= made to restructure the incentives here, as the embarrassed investment ban=ks come under pressure from the regulators and the courts for their errors =of judgment during the bull market, but it remains to be seen whether much =will really change.=20The mystery is why anybody would take notice of these forecasts, and indeed= many professional investors do not. That Merrill survey, incidentally, sho=ws that fund managers on average expect no more than 4 per cent earnings pe=r share growth over the next year, while the stockbrokers  analysts are sti=ll clinging to the hope that it will be 15 per cent.=20A final source of distortion is the tendency of companies to offer their ex=ecutives the wrong sort of incentives. The ruin of Marconi may appear irrat=ional, when multi-billion-pound acquisitions are being declared worthless a=fter only two years. But executives with lucrative stock option plans, whic=h pay off if their gambles go right, combined with golden goodbye and pensi=on packages that are triggered if things go wrong, may well consider it per=fectly rational, from their viewpoint, to take much bigger risks than other= shareholders, or employees, would consider acceptable.=20Moreover, Sir Christopher Gent, shareholders of Vodafone will remember, rec=eived a controversial #10m personal bonus last year for clinching the Manne=smann takeover, a deal that requires #10bn of write-offs.=20In normal market conditions the valuation of equities may be tolerably rati=onal, but in a bubble market the rules are thrown out of the window. Many i=nvestors certainly like the idea of getting rich quickly. That is why many =people subscribe so keenly to national lotteries in which the chance of win=ning is so small as to be not worth rational consideration.=20barry.riley@ft.com.=20(c) Copyright Financial Times Ltd.

Enron, which has been criticized for failing to clearlyexplain how it makes money, may disclose in Monday s filing moreon how much is owed by the company and affiliated partnerships, aswell as any planned job cuts and other cost-saving moves relatedto Dynegy s $24 billion buyout.     ``Investors will be looking for anything that affects thelikelihood of the (Dynegy) deal going through and the timing ofsuch a deal,   said Edward Paik, who helps manage the LibertyUtilities Fund, which owns 1.6 million in Enron shares.     Enron agreed to sell after its stock plunged 67 percent inthree weeks amid an SEC investigation into partnerships run byEnron executives. Investors worry that new disclosures, such aspreviously unreported debt, might threaten Enron s credit ratingand scuttle the merger, possibly pushing Enron into bankruptcy.     ``There s been so much skepticism about what Enron sliabilities are with these partnerships, I m looking to quantifythis,   said Glen Hilton, a fund manager at Montgomery AssetManagement LP, which holds Dynegy shares.     Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay admitted last week that failedinvestments and a loss of investor confidence forced the sale toDynegy, and he and other executives pledged to be more open withinvestors. Lay, 59, said last week he won t accept a severancepackage of more than $60 million that he could have collectedfollowing the takeover.     Enron shares fell 48 cents yesterday to $9. Dynegy fell$1.53, or 3.5 percent, to $42.47.                           Balance Sheet     Enron s third-quarter report, which had been expected lastweek, was delayed by the Dynegy talks and a restatement ofearnings, Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey McMahon said. Enronreduced net income for four years by a combined $586 million toinclude losses from affiliated partnerships.     Monday s filing, called a 10-Q, will include a balance sheetsummarizing assets and debts. Enron for years has omitted balancesheets, which the SEC requires as part of the 10-Q, from its pressreleases announcing earnings.     Investors renewed their criticisms of the practice after Laymentioned during a conference call last month that dealings withtwo partnerships had reduced Enron s shareholder equity, or itsassets minus liabilities, by $1.2 billion. The disclosure led tothe ouster of Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow.     ``Everyone is trying to make their own assessment of what(Enron s) ultimate liability will need to be,   said CommerzbankSecurities analyst Andre Meade, who rates the shares ``hold   anddoesn t own them.     Monday s report probably won t give a complete answer, saidLouis Gagliardi, an analyst at John S. Herold Inc. While thebalance sheet will list liabilities for the partnerships, whichwere set up to buy Enron assets and get debt off the company sbooks, it won t spell out Enron s share, he said.     ``What is the net liability off the balance sheet?  Gagliardi said. ``We really don t know what that number is.                             Credit Rating     Dynegy has said it can back out of the acquisition if Enron slegal liabilities exceed $3.5 billion. The balance sheet ``willhelp us see how good a deal this is for Dynegy,   said KathleenVuchetich, co-manager of the $1.4 billion Strong AmericanUtilities Fund, which owns 284,000 Dynegy shares.     Both companies are based in Houston.     The filing also might offer details on the SEC probe. ``Itmay say what the SEC is looking for, and what the rating agencieshave told them,   said Christopher Ellinghaus, an analyst atWilliams Capital Group. He added, though, ``I don t expect much.       Enron s stock drop led Moody s Investors Service to cut thecompany s debt rating to the lowest investment grade. Dynegy heldoff on a purchase agreement out of concern that the rating wouldbe cut to junk, jeopardizing Enron s ability to raise cash neededto settle its daily power and natural-gas trades.     Enron may reveal where it expects to cut jobs and how much itwill pay to departing employees, Paik said. Chief OperatingOfficer Greg Whalley said last week that fourth-quarter profitwill be hurt by severance payments and reorganization costs. Hedidn t give details.     Jobs likely will be eliminated in businesses the companyplans to sell, including its money-losing telecommunications unitand operations in "

Now shareholders could be on the hook for =a $65 billion tab.Janice Revell11/26/2001Fortune MagazineTime Inc.131(Copyright 2001)It was an irresistible proposition: Borrow billions of dollars, pay no inte=rest, reap millions in tax breaks, and then wait for the debt to simply dis=appear. That was the promise of zero-coupon convertible bonds, and companie=s from Enron to Merrill Lynch binged on what seemed like free money.=20But, of course, there was a catch: For this scenario to play out, a company= s stock price had to rise sharply--and quickly. That s because investors b=ought the bonds in the hope of converting them into equity--if the stock ta=nked, the bonds would no longer be worth converting. So to make them more a=ttractive to buyers, companies had to build in an escape hatch: If the stoc=k price failed to rise sufficiently, investors could ""put"" (that is, sell) =the bonds back to the company--in many cases, after just one year.And that s exactly what s about to happen--to the tune of some $65 billion =over the next three years. Stock prices have fallen so far that for at leas=t half of these special hybrids, the prospect of conversion is now absurd. =It simply won t happen. So bondholders are looking to get their money back =the first chance they can. And because of the put feature, that is possible=. Suddenly companies like Tyco, Comcast, and dozens more are on the hook fo=r billions of dollars in debt and interest they thought they d never have t=o pay.=20That could be very bad news for shareholders of these companies. After all,= they re the ones who are going to be picking up the tab when all that debt= comes due. Huge chunks of cash will disappear from balance sheets to repay= bondholders. Companies without enough cash-- and the majority fall into th=is camp--are likely to face skyrocketing interest charges when they borrow =money anew. That means sharply reduced earnings. Especially at risk are inv=estors in companies with poor credit ratings--prime candidates for killer r=efinancing costs. Some companies may even be forced to issue stock to pay o=ff the debt, creating significant shareholder dilution, especially at curre=nt depressed prices. To make matters worse, this is happening at a time whe=n the economy is barreling downhill and corporate profits are already shrin=king. ""This is a ticking time bomb,"" warns Margaret Patel, manager of the P=ioneer High Yield Bond fund, a top-performing junk fund.=20The seeds of this mess were sown in mid-2000, when the stock market started= to falter. Companies in search of capital balked at the thought of selling= stock while their share prices were struggling. Zero-coupon convertible bo=nds presented an attractive alternative because companies didn t have to ma=ke cash interest payments on the bonds (hence the name ""zero""). Instead iss=uers offered an up-front discount--for instance, investors would buy a bond= for $700 and collect $1,000 when it matured.=20Companies also gave investors the right to convert the bonds into a fixed n=umber of common shares. But the bonds were structured so that conversion wo=uld make sense only if the stock price rose significantly--in many cases, b=y more than 50%. With that protective feature (called the conversion premiu=m), zeros took off. Corporate issuers would pay no interest, and once their= stock prices had climbed back to acceptable levels, the debt would be swep=t away into equity. ""If the bonds are converted, it s a home run for everyb=ody,"" says Jonathan Cohen, vice president of convertible-bond analysis at D=eutsche Bank.=20That four-bagger, of course, depends entirely on the stock price rising. If= it doesn t, the bondholders, armed with that handy put feature, can simply= sell the bonds back to the company. Great for bondholders, but not so hot =for the company or its shareholders. But, hey, what are the odds of that ha=ppening? ""CFOs and CEOs believe that their stock will just continue to go u=p,"" says Cohen. ""They don t worry about the bond getting put.""=20If all this seems a little complicated, that s because it is. A real-life e=xample should help. California-based electric utility Calpine issued $1 bil=lion in zeros in April to refinance existing debt. At the time, the company= s stock was trading at about $55 a share--severely undervalued in the opin=ion of company management. ""We really didn t want to sell equity at that po=int,"" says Bob Kelly, Calpine s senior vice president of finance. So the co=mpany instead opted to sell zeros, setting the conversion premium at a heft=y 37%.=20Still, with no cash interest payments and a stock price that had to rise si=gnificantly to make conversion worthwhile, the bonds weren t exactly a scre=aming buy for investors. So Calpine added the put feature: Investors could =sell the bonds back to the company after one year at the full purchase pric=e, eliminating any downside risk.=20Things haven t exactly worked out as management had hoped. The stock has si=nce plummeted to $25, and it now has to triple before conversion makes sens=e. So it s looking as though Calpine will be liable for the $1 billion in b=orrowed money when investors get the chance to put the bonds this April. Th=ere s also the refinancing cost. According to Kelly, Calpine s borrowing ra=te could run in the neighborhood of 8.5%--an extra $85 million per year in =cash. ""Obviously, nobody plans for their stock to go down,"" Kelly says. ""I =don t think there was one person around who thought the bond would be put.""==20Calpine s potential costs are particularly high because its credit rating i=s straddling junk. ""If you are a borderline investment-grade company, a fin=ancing of this nature is not necessarily the most appropriate thing in the =world,"" notes Anand Iyer, head of global convertible research at Morgan Sta=nley. The problem is, there are a slew of companies with far worse credit r=atings out there: Jeff Seidel, Credit Suisse First Boston s head of convert=ible-bond research, estimates that about half of all zeros outstanding fall= into the junk category. And others are at risk of having their ratings dow=ngraded before the put date. Today, with junk yielding as much as 5 1/2 per=centage points above bonds rated investment grade, refinancing can be a pri=cey proposition.=20Contract manufacturer Solectron is one that could well get hit by the high =price of junk. It has $845 million in zeros that it will probably have to b=uy back this January, and another $4.2 billion coming down the pike over th=e next couple of years. Because of slower- than-expected sales, the company= was recently put on negative credit watch by three rating agencies. And if= Solectron s credit is downgraded, the zeros would slide into junk status, =a situation that could cost the company--and its shareholders--tens of mill=ions of dollars in refinancing charges.=20Refinancing isn t the only worrisome cost associated with these zeros. Comp=anies pay hefty investment banking fees to sell their bonds--up to 3% of th=e amount raised. If the debt is sold back, many will have spent millions fo=r what essentially amounted to a one-year loan. ""They re getting bad advice=,"" claims one banker who didn t want to be named. ""Look at the fee the bank=er earned and look at the kind of financing risk the company got into.""=20As if those potential consequences were not scary enough, shareholders can =also get whacked when the bonds are first issued. That s because some 40% a=re bought by hedge funds, which short the company s stock (sell borrowed sh=ares with the intention of buying them back at a lower price) at the same t=ime that they buy the bonds. If the stock goes down, the shorts make money =from their position. If it goes up, they profit by converting the bond to s=tock. This hedging strategy almost always causes the stock to plummet, at l=east for a while. Grocery chain Supervalu, for example, recently lost 10% o=f its market cap the day it announced it was issuing $185 million in zeros.==20Despite all the pitfalls, the love affair with such Pollyanna bonds continu=es, thanks in large part to the slick tax and accounting loopholes they pro=vide. In fact, the hit on earnings per share can be the lowest of any form =of financing. Even better, thanks to a wrinkle in the tax code, companies c=an rake in huge tax savings by deducting far more interest than they re act=ually paying. All they have to do is agree to pay small amounts of interest= if certain conditions prevail. Verizon Communications, for instance, would= pay 0.25% annual interest on its $3 billion in zero bonds if its stock pri=ce falls below 60% of the issue s conversion price. In the eyes of the IRS,= oddly, that clause enables the company to take a yearly interest deduction=, for tax purposes, of 7.5%--the same rate it pays on its regular debt. (Wh=y? Trust us, you don t want to know.) That adds up to an annual deduction o=f more than $200 million, even if Verizon never shells out a dime in intere=st. Not surprisingly, more than half of the zeros issued in 2001 contain si=milar clauses. ""It s an incredible deal for them,"" says Vadim Iosilevich, w=ho runs a hedge fund at Alexandra Investment Management. ""Not only are they= raising cheap money, they re also doing tax arbitrage.""=20So despite the enormous risks to shareholders, companies continue to issue =zeros at a steady clip: According to ConvertBond.com, seven new issues, tot=aling $3.5 billion, have been sold since Oct. 1 alone. ""I think the power o=f the tax advantage is going to keep them around,"" says CSFB s Seidel. Call= it greed or just blind optimism that the markets will recover quickly--it =doesn t really matter.

All Rights Reserved. =09Manager s Journal: What Enron Did RightBy Samuel Bodily and Robert Bruner11/19/2001The Wall Street JournalA20(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)This is a rough era for American business icons. Subject to the vagaries of= age (Jack Welch), product failure (Ford/Firestone tires), competition (Luc=ent, AT&T), technology (Hewlett-Packard and Compaq), and dot-bomb bubbles (=CMGI), managers and their firms remind us that being an icon is risky busin=ess. The latest example is Enron, whose fall from grace has resulted in a p=roposed fire sale to Dynegy.=20Once considered one of the country s most innovative companies, Enron becam=e a pariah due to lack of transparency about its deals and the odor of conf=licts of interest. The journalistic accounts of Enron s struggles drip with= schadenfreude, hinting that its innovations and achievements were all a mi=rage.We hold no brief regarding the legal or ethical issues under investigation.= We agree that more transparency about potential conflicts of interest is n=eeded. High profitability does not justify breaking the law or ethical norm=s. But no matter how the current issues resolve themselves or what fresh re=velations emerge, Enron has created an enormous legacy of good ideas that h=ave enduring value.=20-- Deregulation and market competition. Enron envisioned gas and electric p=ower industries in the U.S. where prices are set in an open market of biddi=ng by customers, and where suppliers can freely choose to enter or exit. En=ron was the leader in pioneering this business.=20Market competition in energy is now the dominant model in the U.S., and is =spreading to Europe, Latin America, and Asia. The winners have been consume=rs, who have paid lower prices, and investors, who have seen competition fo=rce the power suppliers to become much more efficient. The contrary experie=nce of California, the poster child of those who would re-regulate the powe=r industry, is an example of not enough deregulation.=20-- Innovation and the ""de-integration"" of power contracts. Under the old re=gulated model of delivering gas and electricity, customers were offered a o=ne-size-fits-all contract. For many customers, this system was inflexible a=nd inefficient, like telling a small gardener that you can only buy manure =by the truckload. Enron pioneered contracts that could be tailored to the e=xact needs of the customer.=20To do this, Enron unbundled the classic power contract into its constituent= parts, starting with price and volume, location, time, etc., and offered c=ustomers choices on each one. Again, consumers won. Enron s investors did t=oo, because Enron earned the surplus typically reaped by inventors. Arguabl=y, Enron is the embodiment of what economist Joseph Schumpeter called the ""=process of Creative Destruction."" But creative destroyers are not necessari=ly likable, pleasant folks, which may be part of Enron s problem today.=20-- Minimization of transaction costs and frictions. Enron extended the logi=c of de-integration to other industries. An integrated paper company, for i=nstance, owns forests, mills, pulp factories, and paper plants in what amou=nts to a very big bet that the paper company can run all those disparate ac=tivities better than smaller, specialized firms. Enron argued that integrat=ed firms and industries are riddled with inefficiencies stemming from burea=ucracy and the captive nature of ""customers"" and ""suppliers."" Enron envisio=ned creating free markets for components within the integrated chain on the= bet that the free-market terms would be better than those of the internal =operations. The development of free-market benchmarks for the terms by whic=h divisions of integrated firms do business with each other is very healthy= for the economy.=20-- Exploiting the optionality in networks. In the old regulated environment=, natural gas would be supplied to a customer through a single dedicated pi=peline. Enron envisioned a network by which gas could be supplied from a nu=mber of possible sources, opening the customer to the benefits of competiti=on, and the supplier to the flexibility of alternative sourcing strategies.= Enron benefited from controlling switches on the network, so that they cou=ld nimbly route the molecules or electrons from the best source at any mome=nt in time to the best use, and choose when and where to convert molecules =to electrons. This policy, picked up by others in the industry, created tre=mendous value for both customers and suppliers.=20-- Rigorous risk assessment. The strategy of tailored contracts could easil=y have broken the firm in the absence of a clear understanding of the tradi=ng risks that the firm assumed, and of very strong internal controls. Enron= pioneered risk assessment and control systems that we judge to be among th=e best anywhere. Particularly with the advent of Enron Online, where Enron =made new positions valued at over $4 billion each day, it became essential =to have up-to-the-second information on company-wide positions, prices and =ability to deliver.=20The unexpected bad news from Enron has little to do with trading losses by =the firm, but with fears among trading partners about Enron s ability to fi=nance its trading activity. In a world where contracts and trading portfoli=os are too complex to explain in a sound bite, counterparties look to a thi=ck equity base for assurance. It was the erosion in equity, rather than tra=ding risk, that destroyed the firm.=20-- A culture of urgency, innovation and high expectations. Enron s corporat=e culture was the biggest surprise of all. The Hollywood stereotype of a ut=ility company is bureaucratic, hierarchical, formal, slow, and full of excu=ses. And the stodgy images of a gas pipeline company -- Enron only 15 years= ago -- is even duller and slower. Enron became bumptious, impatient, lean,= fast, innovative, and demanding. It bred speed and innovation by giving it=s professionals unusual freedom to start new businesses, create markets, an=d transfer within the firm.=20Success was rewarded with ample compensation and fast promotion, and an ope=n-office design fostered brainstorming. The firm s organization and culture= was by all accounts not a safe haven for those who believe the role of a l=arge corporation is to fulfill entitlements for jobs. This was a lightning =rod for the firm s detractors. And yet, it could serve as a model for more =hide-bound enterprises to emulate.=20Enron was a prolific source of compelling new ideas about the transformatio=n of American business. It created a ruckus in once-quiet corners of the bu=siness economy. It rewrote the rules of competition in almost every area in= which it did business. It thrived on volatility.=20The proposed sale of Enron to Dynegy risks the loss of a major R&D establis=hment, especially given Dynegy s track record as a second mover following E=nron s lead. Beyond what is likely to be a difficult and time-consuming ant=itrust review, Dynegy s greater challenge will be to find a way to make Enr=on s spirit of innovation its own. Or so we all should hope, because prospe=rity depends on the ability of firms to reinvent themselves and remake thei=r industries.=20---=20Messrs.

Morgan Chase & Co. s portfolio was the only one in The Wall Street Jou=rnal s quarterly stock-picking survey to slide less than 10% during the thr=ee months ended Sept. 30. The value of its stock basket fell 8.6% during th=e third quarter.Just six of the 15 financial firms managed to beat the benchmark Standard &= Poor s 500-stock index, which dropped 14.7% during the period. Among the s=tar performers that came to J.P. Morgan s rescue: Northrop Grumman Corp., S=BC Communications Inc. and Procter & Gamble Co.=20""It has turned into a real stock-picker s market,"" says J.P. Morgan equity =strategist Douglas Cliggott. ""In the first half, the market bought cyclical= stocks, such as credit cards and brokers, in hopes of a recovery. We don t= think those stocks will get interesting until sometime in 2003."" Instead, =the firm s portfolio is weighted toward health care and consumer staples, a=s well as cyclical stocks such as energy and farm equipment.=20The quarter was among the roughest in years for Wall Street investors. The =terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 helped contribute to the stock-market losses,= which drove down the value of all portfolios in the survey, though the mar=kets have since recovered to their pre-Sept. 11 levels. The last time the g=roup posted results this bad was during the third quarter of 1998, during t=he Asian financial crisis.=20Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Credit Suisse Group s Credit Suisse First Bost=on finished at the bottom of the pack, falling 23.2% and 30.1% respectively=. The performance of last-place finisher CSFB was dragged down by losses at= companies such as Veritas Software Corp. (down 72.3% in the quarter), Prae=cis Pharmaceuticals Inc. (down 64.8%) and software provider Amdocs Ltd. (do=wn 51%).=20For CSFB, ""it was not a good stock-picking quarter, that s for sure,"" says =Al Jackson, the firm s global head of equity research. ""It was our tech and= telecom . . . and the events of Sept. 11 that hurt us.""=20Credit Suisse First Boston recently changed the approach to its model portf=olio, opting against sector weightings, Mr. Jackson says. This strategy has= hurt CSFB in recent quarters, because of the steep slump in areas such as =technology and telecom. The firm recently added a number of Old Economy sto=cks to its portfolio, such as Citigroup Inc., Dow Chemical Co. and Gannett =Co. Says Mr. Jackson: ""We are going back to our roots and asking what our b=est ideas are.""=20Like CSFB, Goldman was hit by a drop in the share price of technology compa=nies, such as Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. (down 56.5% in the qua=rter). Its portfolio was also dragged down by shares of embattled Enron Cor=p. (down 44.3%). Morgan Stanley and Royal Bank of Canada s RBC Dain Rausche=r, which placed 6th and 12th respectively, also have the energy company on =their lists.=20In addition to Enron, stocks hard it by the terrorist attacks, such as lodg=ing giant Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc., Walt Disney Co. and air=lines such as Skywest Inc., also hurt the portfolio performance of many sec=urities firms.=20It is unlikely people will buy any company s entire recommended list at one= time.

Its 85% return over five years is the best of the group and ahead of the= total return for the S&P 500 of 62.7%. Perhaps more than any other firm, E=dwards Jones takes a buy-and-hold approach to investing, making very few ch=anges to its portfolio from quarter to quarter, or even year to year.=20""It s the old story of the tortoise and the hare, and we believe slow and s=teady wins the race,"" says David Otto, Edward Jones director of research. ""=We are really, really proud of the five-year number.

That crisis led to Enron s decision e=arlier this month to be acquired by Dynegy Inc., a much smaller rival.The German Bank, Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale of Dusseldorf, or Wes=tLB, is among several suitors for Wessex Water, people close to the discuss=ions said. The sale has also attracted the attention of industry rivals lik=e Thames Water, owned by RWE of Germany. But such a combination would most =likely incur a long review by regulators, who might either block the merger= on antitrust grounds, or exact stiff concessions, industry experts said.==20Wessex Water is likely to be sold for more than $:1 billion ($1.4 billion) =but less than the $:1.4 billion that Enron paid for it in 1998, analysts sa=id.=20  In hindsight, we made some very bad investments in noncore businesses,   =Kenneth L. Lay, Enron s chairman and chief executive, told analysts in a co=nference call last week. Those investments   have performed far worse than =we ever could have imagined,   he said, citing the Azurix water business, o=f which Wessex Water is a part, and energy assets in Brazil and India.=20Executives from Enron were not immediately available for comment today. Wes=tLB executives declined to comment.=20WestLB has been aggressively pursuing acquisitions in Britain, bidding for =British Telecommunications  phone network and the nation s railway tracks c=ontrolled by the troubled Railtrack, which is restructuring under governmen=t supervision. Neither of those bids has progressed beyond the initial stag=es.=20Last summer, WestLB helped finance the management buyout of the Mid Kent Wa=ter Company through Swan Capital, its private equity vehicle.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Here was new money, meaning new spending on p=lants, equipment and jobs that could help pull the economy out of its slump=.=20That $10.9 billion AT&T deal, and a slew of similar bond deals from big com=panies ranging from Boeing and Anheuser-Busch to Kraft Foods and General Mo=tors, may not provide as big of a boost as economists are banking on. That =is because corporations, like homeowners, are in the midst of a refinancing= boom.Corporations are hitting the market not just because rates are cheap, but b=ecause they often can t get money in other crucial markets. In particular, =they are sidestepping the commercial paper market -- short-term corporate I=OUs used to finance day-to-day operations, where rates traditionally are lo=west -- because investors are unwilling to finance many well-known corporat=ions.=20The result has been a huge jump in bond sales, the majority of which are us=ed to reduce existing debt. Since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, about $13=5 billion in investment-grade bonds have been sold, up from about $78 billi=on in the year-earlier period. Overall issuance this year is likely to set =a record, clearing $600 billion, compared with $411 billion in 2000.=20""The driving force behind this surge in bond issuance is refinancing short-=term commercial paper to long-term debt,"" says John Lonski, chief economist= at Moody s Investors Service, a credit-rating agency.=20Usually, rising bond issuance presages economic growth. In 1991, corporatio=ns sold a record number of bonds to exploit falling interest rates. But the=n, companies poured much of the money they raised back into their operation=s, a flurry of investment that foreshadowed the economic boom of the late 1=990s.=20This time around, the surge in bond deals won t pump in enough new money to= the economy to make a dramatic difference. Though, as in the case of the m=illions of homeowners who are refinancing their mortgages to lower monthly =payments, it could help ease some pressure on stretched corporate-balance s=heets and help to fund some of the companies  day-to-day operations.=20Not all of the money being raised is to refinance short-term debt, of cours=e, and the string of bond deals shows that many of the nation s biggest bor=rowers have ready access to funding if they need it.=20But most companies are similar to AT&T, which last week provided the bigges=t refinancing example yet.=20Over the next three months, the telecom company was facing $6.5 billion in =expiring commercial paper. Under normal conditions, corporations pay off ma=turing commercial paper by ""rolling over"" that debt, or issuing new commerc=ial paper to replace the old. But rolling over commercial paper became much= harder for AT&T after Moody s cut the company s short-term and long-term c=redit ratings. Through the bond deal, AT&T raised money at relatively attra=ctive rates while avoiding the difficulties of the commercial-paper market.==20Other companies facing downgrades also are scrambling to find alternatives =to the commercial-paper market through bonds, loans or revolving credit lin=es. ""The ripple effects of this are being felt throughout the capital marke=ts,"" says Meredith Coffey, senior vice president at Loan Pricing Corp., a d=ebt-market-analysis company.=20For the most extreme cases, the bond markets don t offer refuge. Enron, ham=mered by a third-quarter loss of $618 million that led to a string of downg=rades, drew down $3.3 billion from its emergency bank credit line to repay =investors in its commercial paper. It then turned to its banks for an addit=ional $1 billion loan to pay off more commercial-paper investors, thus tidi=ng it over until it could merge with rival Dynegy.=20Most investment-grade companies aren t nearly so bad off, and thus have rea=dy access to bond investors. General Motors, for instance, had little troub=le selling $6 billion in debt last month, while Ford Motor easily sold bond=s totalling $9.4 billion.=20But the surge in bond sales masks signs that even investment-grade companie=s are having trouble convincing investors that they are good for their mone=y.=20Take Ford. Standard & Poor s and Moody s downgraded Ford s debt ratings las=t month to triple-B-plus and single-A-3, respectively. With that rating, Fo=rd is far enough down the spectrum of investment-grade debt that many of th=e ultraconservative investors in commercial paper won t touch it, meaning t=hat it had to turn to corporate bonds to refinance its debt. Ford concedes =that a big reason it is selling bonds was to avoid the trouble in the comme=rcial-paper market.=20Boyce Greer, the money-market group leader at Fidelity Investments, says he= often stops buying the commercial paper of a corporation at the first sign= of eroding profitability -- even before they get downgraded. ""You can t wa=it around for a rating agency [to downgrade a company],"" he says.=20Moody s has downgraded five times as many corporations as it has raised so =far this year. Thus, the market for corporate commercial paper has shrunk t=o $1.4 trillion at the end of October, down from $1.6 trillion at the end o=f last year.=20---=20Friday s Credit Markets=20Last week was a brutal time to own Treasurys. The market sold off so sharpl=y as to push yields, which move inversely to prices, almost back up to wher=e they stood before the terrorist attacks. It was the worst bond selloff si=nce 1987, according to economists at Banc One Capital Markets.=20Losses were heaviest in issues like the two-year note, the most sensitive t=o expectations about Federal Reserve policy. Since hitting a record low of =2.30% on Nov. 7, the two-year yield has risen 0.80 percentage point to 3.05=%. In the same period, the 30-year bond yield has risen 0.50 percentage poi=nt to 5.27%.=20At 4 p.m. Friday, the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was down 1 3/32 point=s from late Thursday, or $10.94 per $1,000 face value, at 100 25/32. Its yi=eld jumped to 4.897% from 4.756% Thursday.=20The 30-year Treasury bond s price fell 1 19/32 to 100 25/32 to yield 5.317,= up from 5.211% Thursday.=20Why the selloff? People in the market cite a shift toward the view that the= U.S. economy may finally be on the brink of recovery. That means the Fed m=ay not need to employ many more rate cuts to get growth back on track.=20-- Michael S. Derby and Steven VamesCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

By comparison, the Standard & P=oor s 500-stock index has slumped nearly 14%.Of course, the risks in Russia remain. Despite recent economic gains, the c=ountry still is struggling with a weak banking system, inadequate state ins=titutions to enforce contract laws and few businesses run by the ""modern"" r=ules of corporate governance, according to Samuel Oubadia the 37-year-old m=anager of the Russia fund.=20""But they are getting more open,"" Mr. Oubadia said, though Russia s lax fin=ancial reporting standards are still one of the main roadblocks for foreign= investors. With $49 million in assets, the Pilgrim Russia fund invests bet=ween 90% and 95% in Russian stock, with the balance held in cash.=20""While the global economy is slowing, Russia is still in an expansion mode,="" Mr. Oubadia said. After years of economic reforms, consumer spending is u=p 10% and the former Soviet Union s gross domestic product is expected to g=row 3% to 5% next year, more than twice as much as that of the U.S. and Eur=ope.=20Two-thirds of the fund s stocks are oil and gas companies, which are still =the most liquid stocks in Russia.

Surgutneftegaz and Lukoil Holdings also make up more t=han 5% each of Pilgrim Russia s assets. While Mr. Oubadia said the companie=s should be able to handle falling oil prices, partly by cutting production=, he worries that further price erosion could hamper a fragile Russian stoc=k market that relies so heavily on oil and gas stocks.=20""Can Russian markets do well with lower prices for oil?"" he asked.

All Rights Reserved. =09Blackout in the power sectorA V Rajwade11/19/2001Business Standard10Copyright (c) Business StandardEvery foreign company in the Indian power sector wants to exit. Of these, t=he most controversial has been Enron and its Dabhol Power Company Ltd (DPCL=). This apart, the experience of investors in the ""reformed"" power sector i=n Orissa is also unhappy. Five years ago, Orissa was the first state to ado=pt the World Bank-recommended model of separating generation, transmission =and distribution of power, and an independent regulator. The Godbole Commit=tee has recently recommended the same for Maharashtra as well.=20Clearly, separating the three functions is a complex restructuring. Maybe i=t helps privatisation, the current fashion on the subject having been set i=n Thatcherite Britain. While some privatisations in UK have succeeded, the =experience has not been consistent all over.Take UK s rail sector. While privatising, the government in its wisdom deci=ded to separate the ownership of the rail network (Railtrack) and the owner=ship and operation of trains. The contractual relationship between the vari=ous operating companies and Railtrack were governed by a byzantine, bewilde=ringly complex system of penalties and incentives, to be monitored by an in=dependent regulator.=20Such separation had no parallel. Besides, Railtrack suffered from poor mana=gement, cost escalation in modernisation of tracks, etc. Several serious ac=cidents occurred and fixing responsibility became difficult. The ""reform"" d=id not work, and Railtrack was put back under public control last month.=20What are the chances of trifurcation of the power sector in India succeedin=g? Pretty poor, if the experience of Orissa is any guide. It faithfully sep=arated the three functions, and privatised distribution and part of generat=ion. AES, a foreign company, was 49 per cent investor in a generating compa=ny, and 51 per cent in CESCO, a distribution company. As Gajendra Haldea an=alysed in this paper on August 27, ""The policy and regulatory framework was= inadequate and myopic.""=20Distribution losses, a euphemism for power theft, were much larger than the= companies had been led to believe at the time of privatisation. CESCO defa=ulted in paying the dues of GRIDCO, the transmission company, which in turn= defaulted to the generating company. Indeed, all CESCO s cash inflows are =now escrowed, leaving it no money even to pay salaries. For all practical p=urposes, the distribution companies seem to be in a difficult situation, pe=rhaps beyond redemption, and the ""reform"" is a total mess.=20The crux of the problem in the power sector is not whether a unified SEB is= less efficient than trifurcated companies it is the political unwillingnes=s to charge a price which covers the cost to all consumers. For a while, cr=oss subsidisation worked with commercial consumers subsidising the househol=d and the agricultural segments.=20However, as the burden became too large, the commercial sector started movi=ng to captive generation, further worsening SEB finances. An ""independent"" =regulator for power tariffs may not solve the problem. He may fix economic =prices but will the state come forward to protect the bill collectors, puni=sh power thiefs, face social unrest if power to recalcitrant consumers is c=ut off? So long as the answers to these questions are in the negative, as, =sadly, they are, the institutional restructuring is no substitute for subst=antive action. No wonder all foreign investors in the power sector want to =get out!=20Enron too wants out but it has many more problems in its home country, over= and above its dispute with MSEB. It had attracted a lot of adverse publici=ty for gouging power consumers in California, a state in a power crisis (se=e World Money, February 2, 2001). The Internet craze also had a hand in Enr=on s misfortunes. It became an energy trader, established an electronic tra=ding platform, had broadband ambitions, went into a disastrous diversificat=ion in water supplies which, if I remember correctly, led to Rebecca Mark s= exit. Perhaps it went into too many areas too quickly under Jeffery Skilli=ng, ex-McKinsey, and was notorious for opaque, complex accounts.=20To top it all, last month it announced that it will take an extraordinary $=1.2 billion charge in its third quarter results for losses in financial act=ivities. Enron s chief financial officer, who was supposed to be in charge =of these, has resigned amidst reports that a private equity fund associated= with him was involved in them. The SEC is investigating the affair and Enr=on s share price is down 67 per cent since mid-October. There are some repo=rts that Shell may make a bid for Enron.=20After its ratings were downgraded, Enron is desperate for liquidity and anx=ious to dispose its assets. DPCL was already on the platter; now a sale has= become even more urgent. Reportedly, Tatas and BSES are interested; so are= the lending institutions. Clearly, if a settlement is to be reached, this =is the optimum time.=20But one is not very optimistic. For one, Delhi and Mumbai will be involved,= and bureaucracies never understand opportunity costs. Our byzantine decisi=on-making processes make timely decisions impossible. Further, if a deal do=es take place, there will be the inevitable allegations of corruption. It i=s much safer for the reputation of the concerned ministers in Mumbai and De=lhi to allow the drift to continue, to ""let the law take its own course"", w=hatever the costs!

It buys a little time if nothing else.Please let us know what else we can do to help.===============================CNNfn-STREET-SWEEP-14Enron Analysis, CNNfn    THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINALFORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.    CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNNfn ANCHOR, STREET SWEEP: Shares of Enron(Company: Enron Corporation; Ticker: ENE; URL:http://.www.enron.com/) losing steam again today. The stock closingdown $2.07 at $6 99 cents a share. A nearly 10-year low. Investorsapparently concerned about a potential cash crunch at the embattledenergy firm. Joining us with more on Enron`s troubles is FloydNorris, financial editor with ``The New York Times.      Welcome to the program.    FLOYD NORRIS, FINANCIAL EDITOR, ``THE NEW YORK TIMES  : Thankyou.    ROMANS: This has been a fascinating story and stock to watchdevelop. First off, what is the latest that drove this stock downmore than 20 percent again today?    NORRIS: Well, yesterday, after the close, they filed a reportwith the Securities and Exchange Commission, and as people studiedit overnight, they were quite surprised. And it got worse thismorning. They disclosed that they have $690 million in debt. Sothey may have to pay next week if they can`t either come up withcollateral, which will not be easy, or persuade the lenders torenegotiate. And what was shocking about that wasn`t that the debtexisted, that was known, it was that they had to pay it so quickly.It turns out, according to what people are telling analysts, thatDynegy (Company: Dynegy Inc.; Ticker: DYN; URL:http://www.dynegy.com/), which agreed to buy them only a week ortwo ago, didn`t know about this. They had not told them,apparently, Enron didn`t realize they had this problem.    ROMANS: OK, wait. There seems to be a lot of things that WallStreet didn`t know was going on. And every sort of revelation is abig blow to the stock. Who is watching what`s happening here andhow can there be so many surprises. That`s confusing to a lot offolks who are following this.    NORRIS: Well, it`s-the fact Wall Street is surprised isn`tnecessarily surprising, but the fact that Enron seems to have beensurprised is surprising. They`ve had a lot of turnover. Itreinforces the suspicion that Jeff Skilling, the chief executiveofficer who quit in mid-year, and perhaps the treasury and chieffinancial officer, both of whom were ousted within the last monthas this crisis grew, may have been the only people who reallyunderstood what was going on there; and that makes you wonder whatelse might yet come out.    ROMANS: Well, what about auditors and what about the boardgoverning this firm. And what about Ken Lay, I mean he is sort ofthe statesman of the industry, isn`t he? and he`s running thiscompany again?    NORRIS: Well, he`s back running the company. The suspicion is,and Lay denies it, he says he knows what`s going on, my suspicionis that he didn`t know the details. He trusted. He understood thecompany was overvalued, probably. This is a man who was taking outhundreds of millions of dollars by selling stock, exercising stockoptions and selling stock. But I suspect he didn`t understand allof the details and now they are coming back to haunt him. The otherthing that is bothering people today is these numbers show thecompany is burning through cash at an amazing rate. And Enron hasnot really given us a good understanding of why they are burningthrough the cash that fast. But it raises questions about whetherthe company can continue operating until its supposed to be takenover by Dynegy by next September. And, of course, the way the stockis trading, it`s obvious that a lot of people on Wall Street doubtthat deal will go through or at least doubt that it will go throughon the announced terms.    TRACY EICHLER, UBS PAINEWEBBER: Floyd, my question regardingshareholder lawsuits. It seems like there`s some validity there.Any new news on the SEC investigation and the magnitude to thoselawsuits?    NORRIS: There`s no news on the SEC investigation. There are, ofcourse, huge shareholder lawsuits. They`re filed against Enron,they`re filed against the current and former officers of thecompany. And they`re filed against Arthur Andersen, which auditedthis company. The accounting regulators are already starting tocheck in again on Arthur Andersen, which used to be the class ofthe accounting business and has had a string of recentembarrassments.    ROMANS: All right, Floyd Norris for ``The New York Times,  thank you so much for joining us .    NORRIS: Thank you.

Both Enron and Dynegy remain committed tothe NWN transaction.  There are no direct implications for the sale asNWN, not Enron, is the issuer of the equity in the transaction.  Thestructure of the seller financing has not changed.  Bruce DeBolt did describe the only indirect impact of Enron s currentsituation--i.e., that there are certain restrictions on Enron s abilityto transfer the securities it holds to an affiliated interest if Enron scredit rating decays to a given point.  The Enron/Dynegy transaction is expected to close in the 3rd Quarter of2002.  We think we can get all regulatory approvals for the NWNtransaction completed and close before that.  I m in Washington, D.C. today and tomorrow.  We have a pre-filingmeeting with the SEC on the NWN transaction tomorrow.  I ll be back inthe office on Friday.

134418,2001-12-19 13:11:13,"     I just got off the phone with Mac Miller, SWPC s attorney.  I told him that the January 8 extension was a surprise to my business client, who was not inclined to agree to it.  However, my client wanted the following information ASAP:     1.  An estimated cost of producing and shipping the discovery requested from SWPC.     2.  The earliest possible time frame on getting the documents and interrogatory answers from SWPC.Miller, not surprisingly, said that this was a surprise to him, but I made clear that my instructions from my client were very firm, and he understood that.  Miller did say that this put him in a bit of a bad position, as SWPC had apparently initially not wanted to agree to any extension, and play ""hard ball"", and he convinced them otherwise.Miller was in the middle of about three urgent projects, but we agreed we would speak tomorrow morning when he was less rushed and he could give me a realistic time frame for production.Miller said he thought what he had from SWPC did include a document that showed when the DDP was paid.  Miller first said that we wouldn t like the answer, because it was before the damage, then said he really couldn t say that, because he didn t know.   Otherwise, he has not requested the customs brokers  file yet, which is in Houston, and will not give me authority to speak with the customs broker about this (nor would I have expected him to).  I got the impression that SWPC itself may not yet have sent Miller all the documents responsive to the DDP/Export House discovery requests.In the morning, I will have our copy service come over and review the documents we will need to produce (since I have not had a chance to review the file for responsiveness, we may not have to produce everything, and may spend less money than the estimate reflects) to SWPC.   Also, I am not familiar with the discovery requested by SWPC that may be due; for instance, whether it includes interrogatories for which we need to draft answers and have someone available who can sign.   I will get my arms around this in the morning and then call you.Let me know if there is anything else I can do.Britt "

134429,2001-12-18 07:05:03,"Another endless e-mail. -----Original Message-----From: 	Clark, Barton  Sent:	Monday, December 17, 2001 8:23 PMTo:	Lindberg, SusanCc:	Grube, Raimund; Carnahan, Kathleen; Tweed, SheilaSubject:	FP&L letter of 11/30 re new GIS ProceduresI understand you are working with Raimund Grube on a response to FP&L re the above-referenced letter. By that letter, FP&L attempts to graft onto the current GIS procedures the requirement that a customer demonstrate within 60 days of customer s receipt of a facilities study that customer has obtained any necessary local, county and/or state zoning permit that allows for construction of the facility specified in customer s request for a facilities study or lose its queue position. My records show  we have received Facilities Studies for the Midway, Deerfield and Corbett projects, but it is unclear whether we have received a Facilities Study for the Pompano project ( no Endeavor files, the entitiy that made the Pompano study requests, etc.). Based on FP&L s correspondence accompanying the Feasibility Study for the Fort Pierce project dated 8/29/01, I believe we concurred with FPL s assessment that neither a Facilities Study nor Interconnection Agreement is needed for that project.Raimund has advised we intend to challenge any attempt by FP&L to graft onto the GIS procedures the new requirement referred to above to the extent the requirement is sought to be applied to Facilities Studies arising out of Interconnection Study Agreements entered into prior to the date of FP&L s notification of the new requirements. It strikes me that if that general argument is not successful, that we still have good fallback arguments, in those cases where we already have received facilities studies, that such a requirement cannot be retroactively applied in those cases. My concern about the new FP&L requirement is that FP&L may be more likely to be successful in applying it in cases where we have not yet received facilities studies ( Pompano?). Please advise me and Raimund when and how you intend to respond to FP&L, and from time to time whether you think we need to take any action regarding the zoning requirements for any of the projects in light of the expected outcome of your objections to the new FP&L requirements. Also please advise if you need any information about the prosecution of the zoning requirements in these cases to bolster your arguments to FP&L or FERC about the unfairness of the new requirement ( it may take some time to pull the info together).FYI, if it is useful to your analysis, my records show the following FP&L agreements/studies for each of the Midway, Deerfield, Pompano and Corbett projects, and the zoning status for each as I understand it. Whether or not essential to your analysis and response to FP&L, by copy hereof I m requesting Raimund  correct or supplement my understandings ( to the extent he is able) so we can be aware of pending interconnection and zoning related requirements for the Florida projects to which the FP&L letter relate.MIDWAY:Interconnection Study Agreement dated 6/9/00 between Midway Development Company and FP&L, and as amended 9/7/01 and 10/8/01, and related Feasibility Study  ( 2 CTs comprising 366 MW) received _______ (have study, but not transmittal letter confirming date of its receipt), and revision thereof received _______( I have neither revised feasibility study nor transmittal letter). The amendments extend the date for executing a definitive Interconnection and Operation Agreement for the project to 30 days after Midway s receipt of the ""official"" draft of the IOA. I am unaware whether such draft has been received or the 30 day period has commenced.Interconnection Study Agreement dated 10/26/00 between Midway Development Company and FP&L requesting interconnection of a third project to FP&L, related to either Midway 2 Power Project Feasibility Study ( queue spots 25 and 30, one CT comprising 212.5 MW ) received on or about April 13,2001, or Midway 3 Power Project Feasibility Study (queue spots 25 and 30, one steam turbine generator, 280.5MW) received on or about April 13,2001.Interconnection Study Agreement dated 11/2/00 between Midway Development Company and FP&L requesting interconnection of a second project to FP&L, related to either the Midway 2 or Midway 3 Power Project Feasibility Studies referred to above.First Midway Facilities Study and Preliminary Revised First Midway Facilities Study ( my index indicates we have these but they were removed from Deal Bench and I don t have copies and can t ascertain date of their receipt), which I assume relate to either the First Midway, Midway 2 or Midway 3 Study Agreements and Feasibility Studies referred to above. It is unclear if we are awaiting additional Facilities Studies under the other requests referred to above.Status of Local/County/State Zoning Requirements: Per the Deal Bench information memo prepared for the Midway project, the St. Lucie Planning and Zoning Commission recommended approval of the rezoning and site plan on 2/15/01, and the St. Lucie Board of County Commissioners approved rezoning and the final site plan on 4/3/01. The approvals are conditioned upon Midway Development Company commencing construction by 4/03. I recollect that there may be another condition, relating to building permits and construciton of a turn off from a county road to the site, that Greg Krause was trying to get resolved immediately prior to Enron s bankruptcy filing, that could require earlier action to maintain the zoning and site plan approval for the project.DEERFIELD:Interconnection Study Agreement dated 6/9/00, between Broward Development Company, L.L.C. and FP&L, requesting interconnection of a project to FP&L, no related Feasbility Study found.Interconnection Study Agreement dated 11/2/00, between Broward Development Company, L.L.C. and FP&L, requesting interconnection of a second project to FP&L, no related Feasbility Study found.Interconnection Study Agreement dated 10/26/00, between Broward Development Company, L.L.C. and FP&L. requesting interconnection of a third project to FP&L, no related Feasibility Study found.Revised Facilities Study ( Enron Broward North 1 Project) and draft Interconnection and Operation Agreement between Broward Development Company, L.L.C. and FP&L ( to be executed on or before 1/1/07), each delivered with FP&L letter dated 11/6/00.Status of Local/County/State Zoning Requirements: Unknown.POMPANO:I have the Pompano files given to me by Kathleen Carnahan, and the FP&L agreements/studies, taken in the name of Endeavor Development Company, LLC, are not part of the file. By copy hereof, I m requesting Kathleen advise me where I might find the Endeavor files. I have a memo from Greg Krause indicating there were two Interconnection Study Agreements in the name of Endeavor for the Pompano project, dated 3/14/00 and 3/20/00, respectively. The status of local/county/state zoning requirements for this project is unknown.CORBETT:Interconnection Study Agreement dated 6/9/00 between Sawgrass Development Company, L.L.C. and FP&L, requesting interconnection of a project to FP&L, and related Revision 1 to Feasibility Study of unknown date.It is unclear if the Revision 1 relates to this 6/9 Study Agreement, or the 11/2 or 10/26 Study Agreements referred to below.Interconnection Study Agreement dated 11/2/00 between Sawgrass Development Company, L.L.C. and FP&L, requesting interconnection of a second project to FP&L, and related Revision 1 to Feasibility Study of unknown date.Note: A memo from Greg Krause indicated there was a third Interconnection Study Agreement dated 10/26/00 requesting interconnection of a third project to FP&L, but no copy of this Interconnection Study Agreement has been found.Facilities Study recieved on or about 6/01/01, related to unspecified Interconnection Study Agreement between FP&L and Sawgrass ( queue spot 19). Letter notes Sawgrass must notify FP&L of its intention to proceed on or before 7/31/01, or request withdrawn. If request received, FP&L to provide Sawgrass with draft Interconnection & Construction Agreement within 60 days of FP&L s receipt of Sawgrass s confirmation that it intends to proceed. Unclear if Sawgrass replied, or if it did, if FP&L delivered draft agreement. Status of Local/County/State Zoning Requirements: Status of Sawgrass or Lauderdale Land applications on behalf of the project/required rezoning and land use approvals for the project unclear. Lessor has sought rezoning that Lauderdale (and its assignee, Palm Beach Development Company) have alleged breaches the Lease Agreement for the project site."

153074,2001-11-26 06:10:48,"Louise, On Monday, prior to my leaving for Buffalo,  I spoke with Dave Gorte and was informed that since the sale of the Napoleonville Land was greater than $2.5 MM, it is categorized as a diversiture requiring a DASH.   Since the negotiations were quite contentious between Reliant, Texas Brine and Enron - we (Eva, Lisa and myself) had worked with Mr. Gorte to create multiple versions of the DASH.  It was not until Wednesday afternoon that Reliant was the chosen ""victor.""  In addition, since I felt you were apprised of the deal and Mr. Gorte had not informed me of an appropriate process, Lisa had waited until we knew who the counterparty was before getting on your schedule. Unfortunately, this meant Wednesday afternoon around 4 pm, but we had been informed by Tammi Schoppe that you were available until 5 pm. Even though the banks were closed, I had wanted to sign the executables on Wednesday so Reliant would not have an opportunity to change their mind over the holiday weekend.  It was certainly not our intent to have you not appropriately briefed regarding the transaction. I will be flying back to Houston today and will be landing around 5 pm.  Both Eva Rainer and Lisa Druzbik are in today and I am leaving instructions to (hopefully) close the deal today.  Julie Gomez will be signing on my behalf -- for detailed questions regarding the negotiations please refer to Eva.  My cell is 713-302-4187. Regards, Jean"

On the contrary, to sweep the accounts without the input of the Directors of these companies threatens the individuals with substantial personal liability. Further, to simply request the agreement of the three individuals who are the Directors of these companies is not onerous, and is consistent with their good faith attempts to discharge their fiduciary obligations as Directors.  Unfortunately, these fiduciary obligations do not recognize the administrative efficiencies of Enron s cash management systems.  If this remains unsatisfactory, please let me know by return. "

As such, for the potential sale of the Napoleonville Land, Julie Gomez will sign on my behalf for LRCI Inc. after both appropriate commercial, accounting and legal parameters have been met. The status is as follows:Texas Brine has been informed that another counterparty has presented a premium bid of $ 3 MM and has the opportunity to counter.  Texas Brine was the first counterparty to try to acquire the land at $2.35 MM.Reliant has slowed the transaction close due to their legal changes to the ""Act of Sale"" document.  As such, Gerald Nemec (my legal) is reviewing the document in conjuction with our Louisiana counsel as well as other relevant internal legal groups (i.e. litigation and environmental).I am confident that the land will get sold and was hoping to close the transaction prior to my leaving.  However, this bidding ""war"" has the potential for ENA to extract an even higher auction price.  The approximate book value of the land is $1.4 MM.I can be reached via Blackberry or cell (713-302-4187).  Eva Rainer, Manager, is also an appropriate person to contact for any questions.Regards, Mrha"

153346,2001-11-07 17:11:26,"PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIALI wanted to highlight my preliminary thoughts.  I suggest we get together so I can get a feel for where you want to go.Objectives:Primary objective is to avoid repayment of the principal Lenders prior to at least January 1, 2002.Secondary objectives are (a) to avoid the Lenders being able to declare a default resulting in on-balance sheet treatment, and (ii) securing firm replacement financing from OPIC, but without risking the availability of the OPIC financing caused by a delay in Completion (I do not have good feel for this aspect of the matter yet, and need to pursue it with Ranabir Dutt when he returns from meeting with OPIC).Primary Issues:1.	Under the Construction Agency Agreement (CAA) can we (ESAT) state definitively that there will not be Completion before 	01/01/02?2.	Is the current running of the Project, for commissioning and testing, risking an argument that there has been Completion?3.	Can Completion be deferred without the Lenders declaring a default (Agent Event of Default) under the CAA , resulting in 	balance sheet obligations?Other Issues:4.	Can the timing of the availability of the OPIC financing be delayed to accommodate a deferral of Completion, without risking 	the firmness or availability of the OPIC financing, particularly in current capital markets?5.	Are lost energy/capacity payments/revenues from deferring Completion a material commercial consideration?The following deals only with items 1 -3.  As mentioned, I need to get a better feel for the OPIC side of things, and item 5 is a commercial matter.Outside Payment Date:As I understand it, the repayment obligation occurs upon the earlier of:	(a)	Final Completion (as certified by ESAT) under the EPC Contract; or	(b)	an Agent Event of Default; or	(c)	the Maturity Date - August 31, 2002.Alternative #1:  Deferring the activities of the EPC Contractor, including to stopping current testing operations, to ensure Completion does not occur this year.The risk is the Lenders declaring an Agent Event of Default. This will also put some risk on the Lenders, however, for improperly declaring an Agent Event of Default for any of our resulting losses, noting:(a)  Completion arguably means (although not entirely clear) Final Completion under the EPC Contract, requiring (i) Facility Substantial Completion (we need to confirm where we are on that); (ii) completion of the final punchlist; (iii) completion of all NEPCO clean-up and final documentation obligations; (iv) NEPCO receiving all releases and lien waivers (knowing the lien release requirements and timing are under applicable law is fundamental); and (iv) NEPCO satisfying all warranty and other obligations under the EPC Contract.  It is fundamental to determine if Final Completion is even a reality before year-end?(b)  It is ESAT that certifies when Completion occurs.(c)  Although there are obligations within the Scope of Authority under the CAA to take all Required Actions (Completion within the Budget and the Plans and Specifications) there is some scope or leeway for ESAT to unilaterally amend the Plans and Specifications, and thereby affect the timing for Completion, provided Completion occurs before August 31, 2001.  It may be too late  (d)  An Agent Event of Default is subject to a 10-day curing period after notice.(e)  The Termination Payment is due within a further 10 days after notice.Alternative #2:  Deferring the process is not necessary.The risk is that we may be moving the Project closer to Completion in the current year and/or an interpretation that the Project is in fact Complete, noting:(a)  The definition of Completion under the CAA does not necessarily require Final Completion or even Facility Substantial Completion under the EPC Contract.  The test is more vague, and could be to a lower standard.  Noting this difference, and understanding the mood of the Lenders is fundamental. (b)  There is an obligation on ESAT to take the Required Actions under the CAA for Completion, as well as potential good faith obligations.      (c)  The Project is currently operating (although as noted, apparently for testing and commissioning purposes).(b)  We may still run the risk, in any event, of the Lenders declaring an Agent Event of Default.Other Items to Consider:The concepts of the Start Date and Commercial Operations under the Consortium Agreement do not seem to be relevant."

153373,2001-11-09 12:01:41,"To follow up our conversations, I met with the Brett Wiggs, Ranabir Dutt and others today, and have made the following clear:1.  Brett Wiggs is to document and implement a process for completion of the project under the CAA that legitimizes that the project cannot be completed to the standard required by the required actions of the Construction Agency Agreement until the new year.2.  Ranabir Dutt is to ensure that it is made clear in any communications with the project lenders that completion to the standard required by the CAA is not going to be achieved this year.3.  Ranabir Dutt is to ensure that the financing from OPIC requires some completion risk or requires a standard of completion lower than what is required for the project lenders under the CAA with all other conditions to funding by OPIC to be otherwise satisfied before completion is a possibility under the CAA.The objective is to ensure that completion and funding risk is ""hedged"" between the project lenders and OPIC, or, if OPIC flakes, to ensure that we can legitimately state to the project lenders that completion will not occur until the new year.A couple of additional points:1.  I told them not to worry about getting to a start date under the off-take agreement to achieve upside from capacity payments this year as it risked the project lenders being able to legitimatize completion this year without OPIC being fully committed.2.  There is nothing preventing the project lenders from asserting that completion has occurred or declaring a default for non-payment this year.  However, I told them that we need to do the right things so that the lenders will face risk of wrongfully attempting to seek repayment if they do so.They all seem to get the message.  I will follow up with them tomorrow.Peter."

(ENE) Chief Executive Kenneth Lay couldreceive a lump sum payment as much as $80 million as a result of Dynegy Inc. s(DYN) plan to acquire Enron, according to a regulatory filing released Tuesdayby the Securities and Exchange Commission.   Under Lay s employment agreement, which originally extended through Dec. 31,2003, Lay was entitled to a lump sum payment equal to the number of fullcalendar years remaining under his contract multiplied by $20.2 million if heterminated his employment within 60 days of a change of control.   In August, Lay, chairman of Enron, resumed his position as CEO following theresignation of Jeffrey K. Skilling, Enron s then-president and CEO. At thattime, his contract was extended to Dec. 31, 2005.   In addition to the lump sum payment, Lay is entitled to an amount for anyrelated tax penalties if the payment were held to constitute an ""excessparachute payment,"" according to the filing.   Dynegy plans to acquire Enron in a stock swap valued around $10.12 billion.   The deal is expected to close sometime next year, in which case Lay isentitled to $60.6 million under his contract if he terminates his employmentwithin the 60 days.

We can include the sithe agreement in the master netting agreement although we do not believe that this will work for Dynegy as it is not a forward contract but an annuity stream which cannot be accelerated, however if they think it works - fine.  We would not want the margin calculated net (it needs to be exclusive of this transaction).  If they were to convert to two swaps in order to allow for acceleration in the master netting agreement, there is an accounting issue for us.2.  In the East we are long physical power from them in the markets which are not pools.  We are short to them in the pools which clear financially and we have no issues in the pools.

But in the wake of post-agree=ment disclosures by Enron that its future earnings are likely to be substan=tially less than expected, the company s stock has been hammered. In 1 p.m.= trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday, Enron shares fell 30 cen=ts to $4.71. The stock is down 94% so far this year and far short of the pe=r-share takeover price. Dynegy shares rose 64 cents to $40.40.Although Dynegy and Enron both say they are going ahead with the deal under= the terms negotiated, Dynegy does appear to have other options. The agreem=ent with Enron contains a broad ""material adverse change"" clause as well as= some specific trigger points that could be invoked.=20Dynegy officials performed ""due diligence"" throughout the holiday weekend, =seeking to learn more about the intimate workings of Enron, which has suffe=red a series of damaging blows. Since mid-October, Enron has disclosed that= some of its officers participated in personally enriching deals that moved= assets off Enron s balance sheet, for a time, to several private partnersh=ips. Those deals are now the subject of a Securities and Exchange Commissio=n investigation. Past treatment of some of those deals has been termed an ""=accounting error"" by Enron and it twice has rejiggered its earnings since O=ct. 16. At one point, Enron restated downwards nearly five years of earning=s.=20An Enron spokeswoman said the company was proceeding in the belief that the= deal would be completed as agreed. Dynegy spokesman John Sousa said the tw=o sides are forging ahead although he acknowledged that the walk-away provi=sions ""are broad, by design, to ensure adequate protection for Dynegy share=holders."" Shareholders of both firms must still vote on the merger agreemen=t.=20Clauses related to a ""material adverse change,"" also known as a ""material a=dverse effect,"" have been the focus of much attention among merger professi=onals this year, due, in part, to the stock market s fluctuations and the e=conomic slowdown that have caused some buyers to reconsider planned acquisi=tions.=20But such clauses rarely are invoked by a buyer or seller because they are c=onsidered extremely difficult to prove. Both parties typically are reluctan=t to lay out specific terms for canceling a deal, much the way a bride and =groom often balk at negotiating a prenuptial agreement since it appears to =envisage a breakup of the marriage even before it begins.=20Furthermore, a key court case earlier this year affirmed widespread views t=hat a buyer can t easily walk away from a merger. In that case, meat-proces=sing concern Tyson Foods Inc. sought to cancel a planned acquisition of mea=t-packer IBP Inc. due to a drop in IBP s earnings and a write-down of an IB=P subsidiary. But a Delaware judge refused to let Tyson cancel the pact, sa=ying Tyson had been aware of the cyclical nature of IBP s business and the =accounting issue.=20In a lengthy June 18 opinion, Delaware Chancery Court Vice Chancellor Leo E=. Strine Jr. wrote that "" . . . the important thing is whether the company =has suffered a Material Adverse Effect in its business or results of operat=ions that is consequential to the company s earnings power over a commercia=lly reasonable period, which one would think would be measured in years rat=her than months.""=20That interpretation has created ripples in the deal-making community, promp=ting some transactions to include more details about circumstances under wh=ich deals can be terminated. Since the Sept. 11 attacks, for example, a han=dful of merger agreements have specified that future terrorist activity wou=ld qualify as a ""material adverse change,"" or MAC.=20A key issue for any firm alleging there has been a material adverse change =is ""whether the new facts go to the guts of the strategic opportunity or is= it just a hiccup,"" says Meredith Brown, co-chairman of the mergers and acq=uisitions group at law firm Debevoise & Plimpton in New York. He adds that =a court ""may be skeptical"" if Dynegy claimed that Enron s post-merger agree=ment disclosures were a surprise.=20The Enron-Dynegy merger agreement includes several triggers permitting eith=er side to seek termination. Enron can quit the deal if it receives a subst=antially better offer, although it is prohibited from soliciting one. In su=ch a case, it could be required to pay a $350 million ""topper fee"" to Dyneg=y and its co-investor, ChevronTexaco Inc.=20Dynegy can alter the deal if Enron faces ""pending or threatened"" litigation= liabilities that are ""reasonably likely"" to cost Enron $2 billion. If thos=e liabilities hit $3.5 billion ""an Enron material event will be deemed to h=ave occurred,"" presumably allowing Dynegy to call the whole thing off. In s=ome situations, Dynegy would be liable for a $350 million fee, as well.=20Karen Denne, the Enron spokeswoman, said her firm doesn t believe that loss=es arising from the normal course of business would qualify as a material e=vent. The liability must result from litigation. Currently, the company fac=es more than a dozen shareholder suits alleging breach of fiduciary duty by= officers and directors, issuing false and misleading reports and other off=enses.=20Deal makers who aren t involved in the combination say the steep drop in En=ron s stock price since the merger agreement was signed wouldn t by itself =give Dynegy the ability to cancel the pact or force Enron to renegotiate it=s terms. Instead, they say, Dynegy would likely have to prove that Enron s =worsening financial condition was an unanticipated event, which could be di=fficult in light of the company s highly publicized problems and Dynegy s f=requent statement that it clearly understands Enron s businesses. Still, th=ere is another standard clause in the merger document that would allow Dyne=gy to terminate the deal if ""any representation or warranty of Enron shall =have become untrue.""=20Other energy companies have abandoned deals following a widening gap in sto=ck prices that changed an acquisition premium. Western Resources Inc. of To=peka, Kansas last week sued Public Service Co. of New Mexico seeking hundre=ds of millions of dollars in damages after it failed to buy Western s utili=ties. The lawsuit accused Public Service of breaching its ""duty of good fai=th and fair dealing"" and said the New Mexico company tried to ""sabotage"" th=e deal as the two companies  stock prices diverged. Public Service denies t=he accusations.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Despite a $35 billion merger completed in Octobe=r, ChevronTexaco Corp. is still not one of the oil superpowers. Nor, at mor=e than $90 billion a year in revenues, is it a scrappy little guy. So Chair=man David J. O Reilly has been searching for a strategy beyond just drillin=g for more oil and gas.=20Now, he may have something: a big stake in the No. 1 energy-trading company=. Chevron Corp. has owned 26% of Dynegy Inc. since 1996, and with Dynegy s =planned acquisition of Enron Corp., the top energy trader, ChevronTexaco is= making the oil industry s most aggressive push yet into this fast-growing =business. It plans to eventually pump $2.5 billion into the combined Dynegy= and Enron to maintain its 26% stake, and it might raise that share. So, wh=ile ChevronTexaco s much bigger rivals run small in-house trading operation=s, energy trading may soon account for more than 10% of ChevronTexaco s ear=nings. ``Chevron is now positioned to be a leader in the business,   says a=nalyst Arjun Murti at Goldman, Sachs & Co.The deal would certainly dovetail with ChevronTexaco s strategy of becoming= a more integrated energy company, with a hand in everything from pumping o=il at the wellhead to trading natural-gas futures. By acquiring Texaco, Che=vron picked up, for instance, a big refining-and-marketing business --which= should balance out the bad times in oil and gas production, says Eugene No=wak, an analyst at ABN Amro. ``When crude-oil prices are down, they ll have= margin improvements on refining and marketing,   he says. O Reilly and oth=er ChevronTexaco executives declined to comment.=20Until now, Dynegy wasn t a big deal for Chevron. Chevron purchased the stak=e for $700 million when Dynegy was still called NGC Corp., and it filled th=ree of the 14 board seats--positions it will keep. Since then, Chevron has =sold nearly all its domestic natural-gas production to Dynegy. The stake ha=s been a good investment: it is now worth $3 billion, ChevronTexaco says.==20Sitting on $2.9 billion in cash as of the end of the second quarter, Chevro=nTexaco can well afford the Dynegy deal, analysts say. And they expect O Re=illy to use some of that to make more buys; the most likely target is a nat=ural-gas company. Maybe it s not so bad being No. 4.Illustration: Chart: CHEVRON S GROWING CASH HOARD=20Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

CEO Charles L. Watson if he had sat= back and gloated. After all, Watson had watched as his bigger, brasher cro=sstown rival sniffed at Dynegy s more cautious strategy, all the while garn=ering most of the credit for reshaping the energy-trading business.=20Instead, Watson picked up the phone on Oct. 24 and called Enron Chairman, C=EO, and longtime acquaintance Kenneth L. Lay to ask how he could help. Lay =didn t respond immediately, but as Enron s stock continued to plunge and th=e company faced a cash squeeze, it became clear what the only realistic ans=wer could be: Bail us out.So two days later, Lay invited Watson to his River Oaks home near downtown =Houston for breakfast to discuss a deal. Over muffins and ``a bad cup of co=ffee   the next day, Watson recalls, they sketched the outlines, and by 10 =p.m. that night, the investment bankers were called in. On Nov. 9, Dynegy a=nnounced that it would pay about $10 billion, plus the assumption of $13 bi=llion in debt, to buy Enron, which is nearly four times its size. The key t=o the deal was Dynegy s immediate $1.5 billion infusion of cash to shore up= Enron s balance sheet and save its credit rating. The money came from Dyne=gy s 26% owner, ChevronTexaco Corp.=20Without that help, Enron--the seventh-largest U.S. company, based on its $1=00 billion in sales last year--may well have faced bankruptcy. Watson says =that he never would have imagined such an outcome in his wildest dreams. ``=I don t think anybody foresaw the problems [at Enron],   he says. ``It s be=en incredible to watch.  =20Watson, 51, has to make good on what may well be his riskiest investment ye=t. If he can pull it off, the new Dynegy will have revenues of more than $2=00 billion and $90 billion in assets, including more than 22,000 megawatts =of power-generating capacity and 25,000 miles of pipeline. It would control= an estimated 20% to 25% of the energy-trading market, up from about 6% now=.=20That would be sweet vindication for Watson s strategy. Dynegy backs trading= operations with hard assets such as power plants, which allows the company= to guarantee a supply of electricity to a buyer. In contrast, Enron has wo=rked furiously to shed power plants and oil- and gas-generating fields, bel=ieving it could earn higher returns using its trading and technology expert=ise to tap assets owned by others in markets including steel, pulp, and pap=er. IRRESISTIBLE BARGAIN. As Enron s stock slid below $9 from its August, 2=000, high of $90, it became a bargain that Watson couldn t pass up. It woul=d have taken years for Dynegy to build up a market-making operation to matc=h Enron s. Its risk-management systems are top-of-the-line. Enron s commerc=ial-services unit, which manages power supplies for corporate customers suc=h as Wendy s International Inc., is three or four years ahead of Dynegy s, =says Steve Bergstrom, president of Dynegy. Watson says he still plans to ge=t rid of the $8 billion worth of assets Lay had earmarked for sale, includi=ng the Portland (Ore.) General Electric plant and oil and gas assets in Ind=ia. For the $1.5 billion, though, if the deal falls through Dynegy will hav=e the right to Enron s prized Northern Natural Gas pipeline, worth an estim=ated $2.25 billion. And Dynegy can walk away if Enron s legal liabilities e=xceed $3.5 billion.=20Watson firmly believes that Enron suffered from a crisis of confidence, not= a meltdown of its core business. Indeed, Enron s wholesale-trading operati=on earned $2.3 billion last year. Says Watson: ``We know the business. We l=ooked under the hood, and guess what? It s just as strong as we thought it =was.  =20But the trading profits were obscured in recent weeks by Enron s accounting= tricks. The biggest danger for Watson is that there are other time bombs t=icking away. Already, the company has slashed its reported earnings since 1=997 by $591 million, or 20% of its total, to account for controversial part=nerships involving Enron officials. The Securities & Exchange Commission is= still investigating. ``We believe it will take more than just a couple of =weeks and a long-term relationship [between Watson and Lay] to do all the n=ecessary due diligence,   says analyst Carol Coale of Prudential Securities= Inc. Dynegy s Bergstrom counters: ``We re pretty certain that most everyth=ing of material consideration has been disclosed.   If not? The massive ear=nings boost provides ``a high margin of error,   he says. A WANNABE. Of cou=rse, regulators may object to the concentration of trading operations. And =Watson will have to mesh two very different cultures. Enron is known for it=s intense, even cutthroat entrepreneurial spirit. Dynegy s operations are m=ore conservative; some compare it to a fraternity. Dynegy s decision to iss=ue new stock options to some Enron employees may soothe battered egos. It s=hould help, too, that Lay decided not to take the $60 million golden parach=ute he could have received in a buyout. As it is, Lay will not have a manag=ement job with the new company.=20Dynegy often seemed to be an Enron wannabe, following it into online tradin=g and commercial services. Still, Dynegy s 361% stock gains last year eclip=sed Enron s 87% rise, and it rankled some that Lay s execs got more credit.= ``Chuck Watson may not have been in the spotlight, but he has always been =at the forefront of this business,   says Bruce M.

Here s what companies should do-=-and what investors need to knowBy Nanette Byrnes and David Henry=20With Mike McNamee in Washington11/26/2001BusinessWeek76(Copyright 2001 McGraw-Hill, Inc.)In an age when giant earnings write-offs have become commonplace, it s hard= to shock Wall Street. But on Nov. 8, Enron Corp. managed to do it. After y=ears of high-octane growth that had seen earnings surge by up to 24% a year=, the Houston-based energy company acknowledged that results for the past t=hree years were actually overstated by more than a half-billion dollars. It= was confirmation of investors  worst fears. Three weeks earlier, Enron had= announced a big drop in shareholders  equity, sparking fears that its hide=ously complex financial statements were distorting its true performance. Ma=nagement pointed to a number of factors, including a dubious decision to ex=clude the results of three partnerships from its financial statements and a= billion-dollar error several years earlier that had inflated the company s= net worth.=20Enron may be an extreme example of a company whose performance fell far sho=rt of the glowing picture painted by management in its earnings releases, b=ut it is hardly alone. This year, Corporate America is expected to charge o=ff a record $125 billion, much of it for assets, investments, and inventory= that aren t worth as much as management thought (chart, page 79). Even if =companies don t go back and restate earnings, as Enron is doing, those char=ges cast doubt on the record-breaking earnings growth of the late  90s.Not since the 1930s has the quality of corporate earnings been such an issu=e--and so difficult for investors to determine. There s more at stake than =the fortunes of those who bought shares based on misleading numbers. If eve=n the most sophisticated financial minds can t figure out what a company ac=tually earns, that has implications far beyond Enron. U.S. financial market=s have a reputation for integrity that took decades to build. It has made t=he U.S. the gold standard for financial reporting and the preeminent place =to invest. It has also ensured ready access to capital for U.S. corporation=s. That a company such as Enron, a member of the Standard & Poor s 500-stoc=k index and one of the largest companies on the New York Stock Exchange, co=uld fall so far so fast shows how badly that gold standard has been tarnish=ed. ``The profession of auditing and accounting is, in fact, in crisis,   s=ays Paul A. Volcker, former chairman of the Federal Reserve and now one of =the leaders of the International Accounting Standards Board.=20Sometimes, as in the case of Enron, fuzzy numbers result from questionable =decisions in figuring net earnings. More often, though, the earnings chaos =results from a disturbing trend among companies to calculate profits in the=ir own idiosyncratic ways--and an increasing willingness among investors an=d analysts to accept those nonstandard tallies, which appear under a variet=y of names, from ``pro forma   to ``core.   (Enron offers its own such vers=ion. Before investors untangled the importance of Enron s first announcemen=t, its stock rose briefly because it told investors that its ``recurring ne=t income   had met expectations.) The resulting murk makes it difficult to =answer the most basic question in investing: What did my company earn?=20Why calculate a second set of earnings in the first place? Because the numb=ers reached by applying generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) are= woefully inadequate when it comes to giving investors a good sense of a co=mpany s prospects. Many institutional investors, most Wall Street analysts,= and even many accountants say GAAP is irrelevant. ``I don t know anyone wh=o uses GAAP net income anymore for anything,   says Lehman Brothers Inc. ac=counting expert Robert Willens. The problem is that GAAP includes a lot of =noncash charges and one-time expenses. While investors need to be aware of =those charges, they also need a number that pertains solely to the performa=nce of ongoing operations.=20That s what operating earnings are supposed to do. But because they re calc=ulated in an ad hoc manner, with each company free to use its own rules, co=mparisons between companies have become meaningless. ``No investor--certain=ly not any ordinary investor--can read these in a way that s useful,   says= Harvey L. Pitt, chairman of the Securities & Exchange Commission. The SEC =is examining whether new rules are needed to clarify financial reports and =perhaps restrict use of pro formas.=20What s badly needed is a set of rules for calculating operating earnings an=d a requirement to make clear how they relate to net income. In the end, in=vestors need two numbers--a standardized operating number and an audited ne=t-income number--and a clear explanation of how to get from one to the othe=r. ``OUT OF HAND.   A widespread consensus is building to do just that. In =early November, S&P proposed a set of rules for companies to follow when ta=llying operating earnings. Only the week before, the Financial Accounting S=tandards Board, the rulemakers for GAAP, had announced that they, too, woul=d be taking up this issue. Volcker says the International Accounting Standa=rds Board is also seeking a uniform definition of operating earnings.=20``Over the past two or three years, the use of creative earnings measures h=as grown and grown and grown to the point where it has really gotten out of= hand,   says David M. Blitzer, S&P s chief investment strategist. ``Earnin=gs are one of the key measures that anybody looks at when they re trying to= evaluate a company. If people want to use an operating-earnings measure, w=e better all know what we re looking at.  =20Without those standards in place, the gap between earnings according to gen=erally accepted accounting principles and earnings according to Wall Street= is only going to grow wider and more confusing. Look at the variance in ea=rnings per share calculated for the S&P 500 for the third quarter: It s $10=.78 according to Wall Street analysts as tallied by Thomson Financial/First= Call, $9.17 according to S&P, and $6.37 according to numbers reported to t=he SEC under GAAP. (S&P, like BusinessWeek, is owned by The McGraw-Hill Com=panies.)=20The lack of a standard measure can be costly to those who choose wrong. Use= First Call s earnings for the past four quarters and you get a relatively =modest price-earnings ratio of 23 for the S&P 500. But run the numbers usin=g GAAP earnings, and suddenly the market has a far steeper p-e of 38.=20How did we get into this mess? Investors and analysts have been calculating= operating earnings for years, and for years, reasonable people could more =or less agree on how to do it. Then came the dot-com bubble, along with inc=reased pressure from Wall Street for companies to meet their quarterly earn=ings forecasts. Suddenly, companies that hadn t turned a profit by any conv=entional measure started offering ever more inventive earnings variants. Th=ese customized pro forma calculations excluded a grab bag of expenses and a=llowed upstart companies to show a profit. ``TOWER OF BABEL.   Pro forma fo=rmulas vary wildly from company to company and even from quarter to quarter= within the same company, casting doubt on their validity. And these days, =the gulf between net earnings and pro forma earnings is wider than ever. S&=P s tallies fall between the two: S&P s numbers are more systematic than pr=o forma, but they aren t followed widely enough to be a standard. ``Investo=rs are facing a Tower of Babel,   says Robert K. Elliott, former chief of t=he American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) and a retired= KPMG partner. ``It s not standardized, and the numbers are not audited.  ==20That makes it tough to evaluate a company s performance. In the quarter end=ed on Sept. 30, Nortel Networks Corp. offered shareholders at least three e=arnings numbers to choose from. By conservative GAAP accounting, the teleco=mmunications giant lost $1.08 a share. The company also provided two possib=le pro forma options: a 68 cents loss that excluded ``special charges,   in=cluding some acquisition costs and restructuring charges, and a still bette=r 27 cents loss that further excluded $1.9 billion of ``incremental charges=,   such as writing down inventories and increasing provisions for receivab=les. Wall Street chose the rosiest one.=20Confusing? You bet. Companies defend their pro forma calculations by pointi=ng out that they re merely filling a void: Investors are clamoring for a me=asure that gives them better insight into their company s future. The goal =is to get to the core of the business and try to measure the outlook for th=ose operations. ``There are good reasons why there is an emphasis on operat=ing earnings,   says Volcker. ``It is an effort to provide some continuity =and some reflection of the underlying progress of the company.   Besides, a=s companies like to point out, they still have to report GAAP earnings, and= investors are free to ignore everything else.=20There s no starker lesson in the shortcomings of GAAP than the $50 billion =asset write-downs by JDS Uniphase Corp., the biggest charge of the year. Ne=ar the height of the telecom bull market in July, 2000, the San Jose (Calif=.) maker of fiber optics topped off a buying spree by acquiring competitor =SDL Inc. for $41 billion in stock. When the deal closed in February, its as=sets ballooned from $25 billion to $65 billion. But by then, shares of JDS =and other fiber-optics makers were collapsing. To bring its acquisitions in=to line with their new value, the company took charges of $50 billion. Desp=ite the fact that the bulk of its losses stemmed from stock transactions an=d involved no cash paid, GAAP required that the charges be taken out of net= income. So according to GAAP, JDS lost $56 billion in the fiscal year endi=ng in June--a staggering figure for a company whose revenues over the past =five years added up to only $5 billion.=20Analysts and the company argue that besides not involving cash, the charge-=off was all about the past, a right-sizing of values that had gotten out of= hand. To analyze the company s prospects, they excluded the $50 billion ch=arge. ``The accounting is not designed to make things look better but to de=scribe what happened,   says JDS Uniphase Chief Financial Officer Anthony R=. Muller, ``and we ll live with the consequences, whatever they are.   Anal=ysts make a similar defense. ``My goal is to figure out what the business i=s going to produce so that we can value the company,   says Lehman Brothers= analyst Arnab Chanda. GLACIAL PACE. Are JDS s pro forma numbers realistic-=-a fair gauge of JDS s ongoing operations? Right now, it s hard for investo=rs to judge. And that s the kind of ambiguity S&P and others would like to =eliminate. In November, S&P circulated a memo on how to standardize operati=ng earnings. Under the proposal, operating earnings would include the costs= of purchases, research and development, restructuring costs (including sev=erance), write-downs from ongoing operations, and the cost to the company o=f stock options. It would exclude merger-and-acquisition expenses, impairme=nt of goodwill, litigation settlements, and the gain or loss on the sale of= an asset.=20When S&P applied roughly that formula to JDS Uniphase, it split the differe=nce between Wall Street and GAAP. Because of differences in what each group= included in their earnings calculations, the results were chaotic. Using G=AAP, the company lost $9.39 a share. S&P figures it lost $3.19, while the c=ompany put the loss at 36 cents. Meanwhile, Wall Street says it made 2 cent=s.=20The S&P standard may make sense, but it raises the question: Where is the F=inancial Accounting Standards Board, the group in charge of GAAP? Chairman =Edmund L. Jenkins says FASB will be addressing the problems. Still, investo=rs shouldn t expect any improvement soon. The pace of change at FASB tends =to be glacial. It typically takes four years to complete a new standard. In= 1996, for example, the board realized that standards on restructuring char=ges had some big loopholes and it resolved to put the issue on its agenda. =In June, 2000, the board finally issued a draft of a new standard, asked fo=r comments, and held a public hearing. In October, 2001, the board said it =still wasn t ready to put a fix in place. Now, the recession has set off an=other wave of restructuring charges, and the FASB still doesn t have new ru=les.=20The slow pace means the standard-setters sometimes fail to react to sudden =changes in the market. The most recent failure followed the terrorist attac=ks on September 11. An FASB task force, unable to come up with a set of rul=es for separating September 11 costs from general expenses, instead told co=mpanies that the disaster could not be treated as an extraordinary item. So= GAAP earnings include costs stemming from the disaster as part of a compan=y s general performance. Many companies have nevertheless broken those cost=s out in their unaudited press releases.=20Many more are likely to do so in the fourth quarter. Indeed, 2001 is shapin=g up to be one for the record books. A poor economy and the devastating aft=ereffects of September 11 have resulted in a slew of unusual charges that a=re unlikely to recur and that no one could have foreseen. But there s a gro=wing concern that the earnings fog is providing managers with cover to hide= missteps of the past within that vast category of supposedly one-time char=ges. The temptation will be to take as big a charge as possible now, while =investors are braced for bad news. Not only can managers sweep away yesterd=ay s errors, but tomorrow s earnings will look even better.=20The basic question comes down to what constitutes a special expense--a char=ge so unusual that to include it in the earnings calculation would be to di=stort the truth about a company s performance. Usually, big charges fall in=to a few categories, including charges for laying off workers and restructu=ring a company, charges for assets that have lost value since they were pur=chased, charges for investments that have lost value, and charges for inven=tory that has become obsolete. In a recent study, Harvard Business School p=rofessor Mark T. Bradshaw found that companies are increasingly calling the=se charges unusual. That gives them a rationale for excluding them from the=ir pro forma calculations.=20Lots of critics disagree, saying such charges are often an inevitable part =of the business cycle and should be reflected in a company s earnings histo=ry. They certainly should not be ignored by investors. ``Charges are real s=hareholder wealth that s been lost,   argues David W. Tice, manager of the =Prudent Bear Fund, a mutual fund with a pessimistic bent that s up 17% so f=ar this year. ``It s money they spent on something no longer worth what it =was, a correction of past earnings, or a reserve for costs moving forward. =Whatever the reason, it s a real cost to the company, and that hurts shareh=olders.   Without standards, excessive write-offs from operating earnings c=an obscure actual performance. Without any rules, companies calculate opera=ting earnings inconsistently in order to put their companies in the best po=ssible light. Dell Computer Corp. is a good example of this ``heads I win, =tails you lose   school of accounting. For years, Dell benefited from gains= in its venture-capital investments and was happy to include those gains in= its reported earnings, where they appeared as a separate line on the incom=e statement. But this year, when those gains turned to losses, the computer= maker issued pro forma numbers that excluded that $260 million drag. Dell =spokesman Michael Maher says the company s press releases and SEC filings b=reak out investment income and give GAAP numbers as well as pro forma. ``In= our view, the numbers are reported clearly,   says Maher. ``It s all out t=here for the consuming public.   PAST PUFFERY. Many experts believe special= charges are a sign that past performance was exaggerated. What should inve=stors make of a company such as Gateway Inc.? Two restructuring charges in =the first and third quarters, minus a small extraordinary gain, totaled $1.=12 billion, or about $100 million more than the company made in 1998, 1999,= and 2000 combined. Which is the truer picture of its performance and poten=tial? The write-offs or the earnings? Write-offs for customer financing are= another example. When Nortel increased its reserves for credit extended to= customers by $767 million in September, it effectively admitted it had boo=ked sales in the past to companies that couldn t pay--in effect overstating= its performance in those earlier periods. In addition, Nortel says booking= sales and accounting for credit are unrelated issues. Tech companies blame= the sharp downturn in their industry for the big write-offs. And these are=n t isolated examples. Peter L. Bernstein, publisher of newsletter Economic=s & Portfolio Strategy, found that from 1989 to 1993, 20% of earnings vanis=hed into write-offs.=20Big charge-offs can also distort future performance. Critics contend that e=xcess reserves are often used as a sort of ``cookie jar   from which earnin=gs can be taken in future quarters to meet Wall Street s expectations. Or c=harges taken this year, for example, which is apt to be a lousy one for mos=t companies anyway, might include costs that would otherwise have been take=n in future periods. Prepaying those costs gives a big boost to later earni=ngs. Rules for figuring operating earnings would help, but this is an area =that will always involve a certain amount of judgment--and therefore invite= a certain amount of abuse. ``People are going to write off everything they= can in the next two quarters because they re having a bad year anyway,   s=ays Robert G. Atkins, a Mercer Management consultant.=20Part of the lure of big special charges is that investors tend to shrug the=m off, believing that with the bad news out in the open, the company is poi=sed for a brighter future. Since Gateway detailed its third-quarter charge =of $571 million on Oct. 18, Wall Street has bid the stock up 48%, compared =with a 6% runup for the S&P 500.=20Often, though, investors should take exactly the opposite message. If, for =example, part of a restructuring involves slashing employee training, infor=mation-technology spending, or research and development, the cuts could dep=ress future performance, says Baruch Lev, a professor of accounting at the =Stern School of Business at New York University. ``Are these really one-tim=e events?   he asks. ``Or is this the beginning of an avalanche?   Indeed, =Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co. strategist Steve Galbraith has found that =in the year following a big charge-off to earnings companies have underperf=ormed the stock market by 20 percentage points. ``LA LA LAND.   Investors a=re apt to be faced with more huge write-offs next year, even if the economy= doesn t continue to worsen. Why? The transition to a new GAAP rule that ch=anges the way companies account for goodwill--a balance-sheet asset that re=flects the amount paid for an acquisition over the net value of the tangibl=e assets. Under the new rule, companies will have to assess their propertie=s periodically and decrease their worth on the balance sheet if their value= falls. An informal survey by Financial Executives International of its mem=ber controllers and financial officers found that at least a third expect t=o take more charges.=20But figuring out the proper value of those assets is no easy task. Unless t=here is a comparable company or factory with an established market price, v=aluing them involves a lot of guesswork for which there are no firm rules. =``What this is really coming down to is corporations and their auditors com=ing up with their own tests for impairment,   says the Stern School s Profe=ssor Paul R. Brown. ``It s La La Land.  =20While the tidal wave of special charges is providing cover for earnings gam=es, it could also be an impetus for change--especially in the wake of the d=ot-com fiasco. Indeed, there are some signs of a backlash. The real estate =investment trust industry was a pioneer of engineered earnings, with its ``=funds from operations,   or FFO. But now some REITs have begun to revert to= plain old GAAP earnings. Hamid R. Moghadam, CEO of San Francisco-based AMB= Property Corp., shifted back to GAAP in 1999. ``The reason I don t like FF=O is very simple,   says Moghadam. ``One company s numbers look better than= another one s even if they had identical fundamental results.  =20There are other steps FASB could take to improve financial reporting and re=store GAAP s status. Trevor S. Harris, an accounting expert at Morgan Stanl=ey, says it could force companies to make clear distinctions between income= from operations and income from financial transactions. Lehman s Willens s=ays companies should provide more information on cash expenses and how they= bear on earnings. An easy step would be to require companies to file their= press releases with the SEC.=20At the least, says Lev, companies must clearly explain how their pro forma =numbers relate to the GAAP numbers. Otherwise, he says, investors ``see num=bers floating there, and where did they come from?   In today s environment= of unregulated pro forma calculations and supersize write-offs, no questio=n is more important to investors.High-Gloss GlossaryCompanies are using a variety of accounting practices to put the best spin =ontheir results. Here s what those terms mean:DEFINING EARNINGS:NET INCOMEThe bottom line, according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAA=P).Sometimes called ``reported earnings,   these are the numbers the Securitie=s &Exchange Commission accepts in its filings.OPERATING EARNINGSAn adjustment of net income that excludes certain costs deemed to be unrela=tedto the ongoing business. Although it sounds deceptively like a GAAP figurecalled ``operating income   (revenue minus the costs of doing business), it= isnot an audited figure.CORE EARNINGSAnother term for operating earnings. Neither core nor operating earnings ar=ecalculated according to set rules. They can include or exclude anything thepreparer wishes.PRO FORMA EARNINGSThe 1990s term for operating earnings.

The equity culture that has generated so much growth over the year=s depends on a clear answer, but getting one has become impossible. Enron C=orp. just announced that its earnings for the past three years were oversta=ted by half a billion dollars. How did one of the biggest companies on the =New York Stock Exchange manage to inflate its earnings by 20% without audit=ors, analysts, ratings agencies, and the business press (BusinessWeek inclu=ded) discovering it? In part, blame the breakdown of standardized accountin=g rules and the anarchy that runs rampant in the financial statements of Co=rporate America. The U.S. needs a new set of accounting rules that gives a =clear picture of financial performance. Without integrity in financial repo=rting, the U.S. cannot hope to remain the preeminent place to invest in the= global marketplace (page 76).=20The dot-com bubble was the first indication that there was something seriou=sly wrong with accounting standards. Companies without much of a business m=odel customized their quarterly statements to exclude a grab bag of expense=s in order to put a positive financial spin on their operations. Wall Stree=t conspired in this and encouraged big companies to join in. Soon, the meth=od of calculating earnings began to vary from company to company and even f=rom quarter to quarter within a company. It is now chaos.A stricter adherence to accounting rules won t solve the entire problem. GA=AP, the generally accepted accounting principles, allow all kinds of one-ti=me expenses and noncash charges. This obscures the performance of ongoing o=perations. No one can fathom what are true operating earnings because there= are no guidelines as to what constitutes an extraordinary expense. The res=ult is total confusion. Take earnings per share for the Standard & Poor s 5=00-stock index for the second quarter. Under Thomson Financial/First Call s=tandards, it is $11.82. But it s $9.02 according to S&P and $4.83 under GAA=P. How can investors make intelligent decisions?=20The Financial Accounting Standards Board clearly is failing to do its job. =It has promised to write a set of rules that calculates operating earnings =and relates them to net earnings, but it hasn t delivered. The rating agenc=y Standard & Poor s (owned by The McGraw-Hill Companies, as is BusinessWeek=) is doing a better job. It recently drew up a definition of ``operating ea=rnings   that includes restructuring costs (including severance), writedown=s from ongoing operations, and the cost of stock options. It excludes merge=r and acquisition expenses, litigation settlements, impairment of goodwill,= and gains or losses on asset sales. This is a beginning that FASB should b=uild on.

But the stock market, after an initial selloff, has= shown remarkable resilience.=20Few observers expect stock-market volatility to subside soon. Still, expert=s say that now, more than ever, is the time for skittish investors to keep =their wits about them.In a recent interview, Charles R. Schwab, chairman and co-chief executive o=f Charles Schwab & Co., the San Francisco-based online and discount brokera=ge firm, gave his views on what investors should be doing -- and what mista=kes they should avoid.=20Here are some excerpts from the interview:=20In the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks, how much more risk, if any, do you thi=nk is in the financial markets? Or do you think it s just that people s per=ceptions about risk have changed?=20I ve been investing since 1959, and I have to say that, year after year, th=e risk hasn t changed. The risk is always there. There s risk in investing =in stocks, bonds and even U.S. Treasuries because of interest-rate [fluctua=tions]. There s risk in real estate, too.=20So the question is: How do you handle it? The best way is to diversify. Ove=r a long period of time, people who diversify their investments do pretty d=arned well. When they don t . . . sometimes it s fatal. If the only stock a=n investor owned was Enron . . . or Cisco at 70, that was pretty fatal.=20What do you say to people who say they re too scared to invest right now? T=hat because of the threat of terrorism, the anthrax scares, the war in Afgh=anistan, the recession, and so forth, there s just too much uncertainty in =the markets?=20I remember back during the Cuban missile crisis, we all feared the worst. W=e were all building bomb shelters. It was a scary time. This terrorist thin=g is no different. It s awful -- particularly for our children. But this co=untry is so wealthy, in terms of its resources, intellectual capital and th=e strength of our government.=20There is no more uncertainty today than in times past. For example, we ve h=ad many recessions. It s not fun, especially when you begin reading about a=ll these layoffs. In fact, I think the unemployment rate [now at 5.4%] pret=ty easily might get to 6.5% before it gets better. And it probably won t ge=t better until March or April. Also, the stock market will go up, hopefully= before the economy goes up.=20There s $2 trillion sitting in money-market accounts. That s a huge resourc=e and buying power that s definitely available for new investments.=20What do you think is the biggest mistake investors have made over the past =two or so months?=20They let their emotions take over. With the fear that people had, they didn= t use their rational thinking. They used their emotional thinking. [After =Sept. 11], they sold at the low, and fear was the driver.=20Just a year and a half ago, the driving emotion was greed. You re not going= to avoid this stuff. So the issue is how you manage through these cycles o=f fear and greed. Even when I m fearful of something, I say to myself: ""Thi=s is still the time to invest.""=20My biggest worry right now is that people will give up and say, ""I just don= t want to be in the stock market at all."" And it s just the time that peop=le should be hanging on and keeping a diversified portfolio.=20Some other mistakes: A lot of people hang on to the stock that was the post=er child of the last cycle. Or people say, ""I ll get back in [the market] w=hen I see the economy turn around."" Well, by the time they see that, it s t=oo late. They will have missed the whole ride back up.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The new 21-mile pipe section put into service last Friday increases the company s ability to deliver natural gas to western markets by 42,000 Dth/d a year earlier than expected and in time for the 2001 winter heating season. ""We applaud the efforts of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to expedite the permitting process so that some of this new capacity could be in service before the winter heating season,"" said Thomas B. King, president and COO of PG&E National Energy Group s West Region, which includes subsidiary GTN. The new 42-inch pipe is in Spokane County, WA, and Kootenai County, ID, and represents the first installation of a third pipe, known as the C line, in GTN s mainline right of way. The new pipe became operational last Friday. GTN s 2002 Expansion Project also will include new 19,500 hp compressor units at five existing stations on the GTN mainline, which will increases its capacity by 220,000 Dth/d, mainly to serve power generation projects planned by Newport Northwest LLC and Calpine. Newport is developing a 1,300 MW generating plant near Wallula, WA, and two plants of similar size at other locations in the Pacific Northwest. Calpine has several generating projects in construction or development in the Pacific Northwest and California. GTN also has filed with FERC for a certificate to build a second expansion for service commencing in the fall of 2003. The proposed 2003 expansion project would add another 143,000 Dth/d beginning in the fall of 2003, plus an additional 20,000 Dth/d of winter-only service. The 2003 expansion project calls for an additional 53 miles of new C line pipe, plus the installation of one 19,500 hp compressor unit on the mainline system. Combined, the 2002 and 2003 expansion projects would put the total GTN capacity at nearly 3,100,000 Dth/d. ""The 2002 and 2003 expansion projects will provide much-needed natural gas transmission capacity to supply electric generation projects already in construction or advanced development in California and the Pacific Northwest,"" King said. In addition, GTN is exploring the possibility of building a pipeline lateral from its mainline system near Spokane, WA, to the Interstate 5 corridor near Seattle/Tacoma. The company has been in discussions with potential shippers about the Washington lateral project since an open season was completed in June 2001.  ""There is clearly market interest in this project,"" King said. ""We have successfully completed much of the initial feasibility studies for the Washington lateral project and are ready to move to development when the market indicates it is ready."" The GTN system went into service on Dec. 2, 1961, with initial capacity of 580,000 Dth/d. The original system, inaugurated as Pacific Gas Transmission Co., consisted of one 36-inch pipe, the A line. The mainline system grew over the last four decades, first through the addition of a second pipe, the B line, measuring 42-inches, and now with the beginning of the C line. The system includes 1,356 miles of pipeline along a 612-mile route which begins at the Idaho/British Columbia border, traversing through northern Idaho, southeastern Washington and central Oregon, and terminates at the Oregon/California border, where it interconnects with the Pacific Gas and Electric Co. pipeline system and Tuscarora Gas Transmission."
157265,2001-11-13 08:05:42,"NGI s Daily Gas Price Index published : November 13, 2001Watson: Enron Upside  Clearly Worth Doing the Deal  Dynegy CEO Chuck Watson told the investment community Monday that he was ""90% sure"" that the risk/reward ratio in the planned merger with Enron Corp. made it ""clearly worth doing the deal,"" because the issues that decimated the former market leader were with its non-core businesses. Explaining that his team had ""adequately bracketed the downside,"" as the deal fell together over the past few weeks, Watson said he could not be ""99% positive,"" but noted that the upside was ""substantial,"" and said he had a ""good deal of confidence...that we ll be absolutely fine here."" Dynegy, which announced a $22 billion cash, stock and debt deal with its downtown Houston rival on Friday night, joined with Enron executives including Chairman Kenneth Lay on Monday to answer as many questions as they could in about 90 minutes. If all goes to plan, the two companies would become Dynegy Inc. by the third quarter of 2002, the clear leader in natural gas and power marketing. In the second quarter 2001, Enron and Dynegy combined sold a total of 36.2 Bcf/d of gas, which represented 21% of the volumes sold by the top 20 gas marketers in North America (168.9 Bcf/d), according to a ranking by NGI. Enron was the top gas marketer with 25.3 Bcf/d and Dynegy was No. 6 with 10.9 Bcf/d. Statistics provided by Maryland-based Energy Performance Review (EPR) show that Enron and Dynegy combined sold 143,824 million kWh of power in the second quarter. That total represented 14% of the power sold by the top 20 largest power marketers (1,000,961 million kWh), according to EPR. Enron was in fifth place among power marketers with 73,724 million kWh sold, while Dynegy was in sixth place with 70,100 million kWh. The blending of the two will not come without challenges, but Watson stressed he expects to see more opportunities than problems. The opportunity appears to have come none too soon for Enron. Greg Whalley, Enron s president and a future member of Dynegy s executive team, confirmed that without some kind of equity investment in the company, the once market leader probably could not have sustained its liquidity through the rest of this year. ""We definitely needed to raise some type of equity capital,"" said Whalley. ""Under normal market conditions, we would have had adequate liquidity. This was not normal for Enron. We would not have had liquidity to the end of the year."" Asked about asset sales in anticipation of meeting federal requirements to merge, executives acknowledged there would be some, but did not elaborate. Whalley said that from an ""Enron perspective, we have not spent a lot of time with Dynegy people to agree on a plan. Chuck (Watson) has to clear what is core to Dynegy. There are several (assets for consideration to sell) on the list."" Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay, who will not be part of the management team, but may hold a place on the Dynegy board of directors, added that Enron already has $4 billion in sales under contract, all expected to close by the end of 2002. ""We also have three other significant international assets under contract,"" said Lay, referring to the among other things, the Dabhol power plant in India. Once the merger of Dynegy with Enron is successfully completed, the new Dynegy will become the ""primary market player in all markets,"" but there will be a significant difference in how the company moves forward, noted Dynegy CFO Rob Doty. Enron s financial-backed trading strategy will merge with the ""strong asset base"" of Dynegy s. Dynegy has protected itself on the downside, however. The deal includes an out for Dynegy if Enron s legal liabilities exceed $3.5 billion. Asked about the possibility that some of Enron s marketing and trading team may desert the company for another company, Watson, stressing that teamwork will be the guiding force going forward, said, ""if I were in this industry, this is the combination I d work for. This is an exciting day here. It s been an exciting couple of weeks"" creating a ""platform for something really special in the future."" Enron s Whalley said that he believes the company will keep most of its team intact. ""They re accustomed to being part of a winning deal,"" he said, and ""going forward, they will be very pleased with the additional infusion of equity and the stability in the marketplace."" As of Monday morning, Whalley said that ""activity looks pretty good,"" and said there had been a positive reception to the merger. ""Right now, people are pleased with the introduction of new liquidity, and really want to go about establishing or re-establishing the energy franchise."" Dynegy President Steve Bergstrom agreed. ""Most traders want to be part of a winning team. This is a combination that will be a winning team. We have similar issues there as well. The  A  players will stay around to be part of the winning team."" Bergstrom explained that when the merger is complete, the new Dynegy will become the ""primary player in all markets."" He said Dynegy has a ""more asset-backed strategy,"" adding that he has said before that ""you can only have one market maker and Enron clearly was it."" By combining the two companies, there will be a blend of Dynegy s asset strategy with Enron s ""financial skill set,"" giving the new entity ""more liquidity market-making than Dynegy itself has historically done."" Added Watson, ""both companies had a successful ratio and nothing is going to change there...I m a strong believer in teams and the team concept. I don t want to see individuals do well if the company doesn t do well. It (will be) imbedded in the whole company."" Ben Schlesinger, whose company Schlesinger & Associates analyzes the energy industry, said Monday that the big problem in the merger is ""whether these two companies are able to pull together...to harness what s there."" He said the ""two parties are clearly leaders,"" but theoretically, they will have to streamline their operations. ""Both books are fairly strong,"" he said, and once their efficiencies are put together, the new company will offer ""stable returns."" In the ""very short term,"" however, Schlesinger said there will be moves to other traders. Other analysts also seemed to be throwing support behind the merger. UBS Warburg reiterated its ""strong buy"" rating on Dynegy, noting that ""if successfully executed, this transaction would yield the most widely recognized, respected and downright credible wholesale/retail energy merchant in the world."" However, UBS warned that Dynegy still faces a ""daunting"" task in merging the operations and employees. ""We are not naive in underestimating the enormous challenge at hand. In the near-term, Enron must remain highly liquid, investment grade and its employees must remain focused on keeping its core wholesale/retail franchises up and running."" Merrill Lynch s Donato Eassey reiterated the ""buy"" on Dynegy and ""moving to no opinion"" on Enron. He said, ""Dynegy has all the necessary skill sets and as importantly, the financial stability, resources and investor confidence and experience to get the job done...Enron s unparalleled online trading business should translate to significant prospects for the new Dynegy."" Curt Launer, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston, added that despite the size of the new company, ""we do not expect major divestitures or closing issues because of the lack of asset concentration and the inherent competitiveness of the natural gas and power marketing business."" He noted too that with the combination, ""we have modeled a merchant unit that does 25% less business,"" because of ""cross trading between them and some expectation of a loss of market share."" Still, Launer said Dynegy would become a ""formidable competitor"" benefiting from a market share in excess of 20% of U.S. natural gas and power trading markets."" As expected with most major merger announcements, Moody s Investors Service placed the ratings of Dynegy and its subsidiaries under review for possible downgrade, noting that ""notwithstanding the franchise benefits of the proposed merger, the financial and business risks associated with the transaction could negatively impact Dynegy s credit fundamentals."" The review affects about $4 billion of Dynegy securities, including its subsidiaries Illinova Corp. and Illinois Power Co. In its rating review, Moody s said it will ""assess Dynegy s plans to meet the liquidity needs of the combined entity and to deal with the uncertainty surrounding Enron s off-balance sheet transactions and contingent risks...and examine the ultimate structure of the transaction, and its impact on Dynegy s financial leverage and on management s targeted debt levels."" The ratings service also plans to ""consider the governance framework within which the combined trading activities will operate."" Ratings under review are: Dynegy s Prime-3 rating for commercial paper; Dynegy Holdings  Baa2 senior unsecured debt rating and its Prime-2 rating for commercial paper; Illinova Corp. s Baa3 senior unsecured debt rating; and Illinois Power Co. s Baa1 senior secured and Baa2 senior unsecured debt ratings, and its Prime-2 rating for commercial paper. Fitch revised its rating watch on Enron s outstanding securities to ""evolving"" from ""negative,"" where they were placed in late October. The rating watch evolving means the ratings may be raised, lowered or maintained. Fitch also placed a rating watch negative on Dynegy and Dynegy Holding s long-term credit ratings, which also means they could be lowered or affirmed. The outstanding ""F2"" rated commercial paper programs for Dynegy and Dynegy Holdings were not affected."

Here are my notes.  Did not yet have a chance to organize them, so they re simply in chronological order.The call began with Watson, Bergstrom, and Whalley reading from prepared statements.  Watson spoke for c. 10 minutes, Bergstrom for 5, and Whalley spoke for perhaps 30 seconds.  Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call.  Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them.  Specific points:EES will be a part of the new company.  Enron assets will be revalued at closing.  The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred.  If the merger does not go through, Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for  very little  additional consideration.  If DYN terminates the merger and ENE  has sufficient liquidity , ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred.  Debt/equity of combined company expected to be <45%.Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative.  ChevronTexaco will hold 169MM shares out of a total 650MM shares of the post-merger entity.  Watson reiterates that going forward, the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure, with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage.  In what was termed a ""new approach"", the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings.  Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true.  Dynegy owed Enron <$50MM.  Lay says that Enron had other options,  particularly financial .All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks.Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be  pretty big , but that the companies feel they re able to appropriately value this exposure.Lay says we have nothing else to hide, but internal investigation still under way.  Lay:  had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps $30MM more of risk capital, there would have been no question that they would have qualified for off-balance-sheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs.Dynegy says that  several  internal investigations continue at Enron, and thus DYN/ENE cannot say with certainty that there s absolutely nothing else out there.Doty (Dynegy CFO) says that late last week, ENE had  close to a billion  in cash.  Osprey will be unwound late next summer. Marlin will be unwound after closing.Many of the off-balance-sheet structures, including the credit-linked notes, are expected to be unwound/redeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing.With regard to ENE asset dispositions, these will be accelerated to the extent possible.  However, Doty says that  our backs are not against the wall , and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash.ENE will renew its 364-day facility (believe this is the $3Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago) within the next 6-8 weeks.  BBB-flat most likely rating for combined entity, according to initial comments from ratings agencies.McMahon says  no comment  to WSJ article indicating that ENE s banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks.Consolidation of trading activity: Mid- and back-office consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing, such that only the front office / trading books will need to be combined at closing.  EES, NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity, so there won t be much integration work required there.  The big integration effort will be ENA.Watson says that the  creative financing  surrounded non-core assets.  Doty adds that,  frankly , DYN assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model.  They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assets/businesses and left it at that.Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by  Enron s top three executives , who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies.  Says that their approach evidenced a  willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegy s deliberations on proceeding with the merger.Watson/Doty said that they re NOT 100% sure that no surprises remain in Enron s books--but that the risk/reward offered by the combination was compelling. The deal does have material-adverse-change outs for Dynegy, covering any MAC regarding Enron s assets or businesses.  Dynegy s lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a  blunt instrument  under which it would be difficult to bring a case, so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enron s total legal liability (from any source or cause of action) tops $3.5Bn prior to closing.McMahon adds that there  could  be more restatements, but he  does not expect  there to be more restatements.ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list.The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron.Enron is planning to hold an Enron-specific conference call in the next few days, tentatively scheduled for Wednesday.Initial reaction of ratings agencies  very positive  to combined entities.  McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end, had the merger not materialized.Dynegy s earnings guidance places Enron-related earnings accretion at $0.90-0.95, which represents a  25% haircut  to Enron internal estimates.  Doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies.Doty says that both Enron and Dynegy s books, as far as he understands, are relatively short-term in weight, and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity.  Says a  very very substantial  portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash.ChevronTexaco s investment in Dynegy was calculated at a 5% discount to public prices on the date of negotiation (not disclosed).  Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week, ChevronTexaco s investment is now at a  more substantial  discount to market prices.  ChevronTexaco has provision to get  different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better .  (No further clarification given).Whalley believes that  we ll retain  the Enron traders and marketers. They re used to being part of a winning team, and the combined entity will definitely be a winner.  They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders, and they are  very excited  by the combination.  They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained.  Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions.  He says that  to the extent necessary, yes. Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENE--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus, but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the Dynegy of today.Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture, he s a strong team player.  He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well.Give me a call if you d like me to try to clarify any of these comments.Patrick Tuckerx3-3055"

RESOURCESCheck stock quotes. Enter ticker for Enron: ENE Enter ticker for Dynegy: DYN     Fractions DecimalsThose business units, which are worth as much as $8 billion, could be sold off or spun out over the next year, the company said in a conference call with analysts on Wednesday. That would bring in more cash to pay down debt and trim away money-losing operations. Enron Chief Executive Officer Ken Lay surprised many with a blunt assessment of the company s poor judgment in recent years that led to the rapid implosion of the energy trading giant s reputation and value in the past month. ""In hindsight, we made some very bad investments in noncore businesses,"" Lay said. ""The negative impact of these investments has been exacerbated through the extensive use of debt capital both on and off the balance sheet. We fully understand and regret that the combination of these events has resulted in the complete loss of investor confidence."" To help make the cuts, the company is breaking its businesses into three groups: those that are the most profitable and part of its core business, such as energy and gas trading; those that are unprofitable and nonessential, such as overseas power plants; and those that have good profit potential in the near future that are under review, such as its steel, pulp and paper-trading operations. The noncore operations will be sold or closed down in an orderly fashion in the next year, said President and Chief Operating Officer Greg Whalley. Those operations under review will be studied to see if they can contribute to the company s bottom line any time soon ""These are businesses that have strong prospects and that we feel have good potential, but we ll need to look at each carefully,"" he said. The company s central businesses of energy and gas trading are not expected to be cut back significantly, Whalley said, and should remain intact until the merger. Despite reports that many employees are leaving those business groups, company officials have said repeatedly that is not the case and that top employees are being retained. A stipulation of the Dynegy-Enron merger agreement prevents Dynegy from recruiting or hiring Enron staff for a certain period, in case the purchase is not completed. The $8 billion in business units that could be sold in the coming year do not include Portland General Electric, the Oregon power company that was already under contract to sell for $2.9 billion next year. Nor do they include about $800 million in asset sales that are expected to close by year s end, Chief Financial Officer Jeff McMahon said. That includes about $250 million for a Brazilian gas distribution business, $266 million for a power plant in Puerto Rico and $332 million for certain offshore energy properties in India. The company did not file a final version of its third-quarter financial statement Wednesday as previously expected but rather said it would be five days late with the document. Enron did, however, share some more details about some of its financing partnerships, including the Marlin and Osprey investment vehicles. Marlin is a vehicle created to acquire Azurix, an Enron unit that owns British water utility Wessex. It has over $900 million of debt that s due in July 2003. McMahon said that if the value of Wessex is 25 percent below its current book value of $2.6 billion when Marlin s debt falls due, this would result in a charge of $650 million against earnings and stockholders  equity for Enron. Osprey was created to acquire energy assets and other assets, and has $2.4 billion of debt that falls due in January 2003. McMahon said that if the Osprey assets were valued at less than 25 percent of their current book value when the debt falls due it would result in a charge of $600 million against earnings and stockholders  equity for Enron. Analysts asked repeatedly if executives were confident that no other surprise liabilities were hiding in the books, referring to the $1 billion in equity write-downs the company reported last quarter due to several off-balance-sheet financing deals, and a restatement of 4 1/2 years of financial statements to include an additional $600 million in losses. McMahon said the company has gone through the books carefully, but he noted that the Securities and Exchange Commission and a special committee of the Enron board of directors were still conducting their own investigations. ""Everything we know, you now know,"" Lay told the analysts. Lay said the fourth-quarter results are expected to be hampered by severance and restructuring costs, however, but couldn t provide more details. He said the company is also seeking an additional $500 million to $1 billion in private equity investments.

(ENE) Chief Executive Kenneth Lay couldreceive a lump sum payment as much as $80 million as a result of Dynegy Inc. s(DYN) plan to acquire Enron, according to a regulatory filing released Tuesdayby the Securities and Exchange Commission.   Under Lay s employment agreement, which originally extended through Dec. 31,2003, Lay was entitled to a lump sum payment equal to the number of fullcalendar years remaining under his contract multiplied by $20.2 million if heterminated his employment within 60 days of a change of control.   In August, Lay, chairman of Enron, resumed his position as CEO following theresignation of Jeffrey K. Skilling, Enron s then-president and CEO. At thattime, his contract was extended to Dec. 31, 2005.   In addition to the lump sum payment, Lay is entitled to an amount for anyrelated tax penalties if the payment were held to constitute an ""excessparachute payment,"" according to the filing.   Dynegy plans to acquire Enron in a stock swap valued around $10.12 billion.   The deal is expected to close sometime next year, in which case Lay isentitled to $60.6 million under his contract if he terminates his employmentwithin the 60 days.

171907,2001-11-26 11:03:10,"	By telefax of November 21, Uriel Dutton of F&J provided a proposed waiver letter agreement for our review.  I will have copies of that proposed agreement circulated by hand-delivery and fax to all those on this list and to Mariner s GC.  At present,  I am not sending this e-mail to Mariner s GC. If there is someone else I need to send this e-mail to, please let me know.  	Chuck and I have reviewed the letter, believe it to be overly broad, and hope that F&J is willing to negotiate further, along the following lines:	1.  On page 1, third full paragraph, second line, we suggest inserting ""Enron Corp. and "" between ""representation of"" and ""Enron s affiliates"".	2.  On page 4, paragraph (4), we are concerned about the third sentence, which reads as follows:  ""Enron Corp. agrees that it will cause each existing or future affiliate of Enron Corp. to comply with the agreements of the Enron Entities herein set forth.""  We think, although we do not know for sure, that F&J s concern is that F&J may become adverse in the future to some existing Enron entity that F&J does not currently represent,  or that does not currently exist, and that either of these two entities may seek to assert disqualification based on F&J s current representation of Enron entities.  If this is the reason for the sentence, we don t see how an existing Enron entity or future Enron entity could assert a conflict that has been waived by the Enron entity that is actually being represented.	      We also have a concern about asking Enron Corp. to cause all of its ""affiliates"", as defined in the letter agreement, to comply with it.  Enron Corp. may not have the power to require all its ""affiliates"" to comply.  Our suggestion would be that this letter agreement be signed on behalf of all the actual Enron entities currently represented by F&J, including Mariner.	 3.  On page 4, 17 lines from the top, we find objectionable the language that begins, ""Without limiting the foregoing...""  It seems to us that here, F&J wants all the Enron companies to be considered separately for disqualification purposes, and perhaps to be able to sue one Enron entity even though F&J is representing another Enron entity in a substantially related matter.	3. On pages 4-5, paragraph (5), we have a concern about the third sentence, which reads as follows:  ""If Dynegy declines or fails to do so promptly after receipt of our request, it is expressly agreed and understood that F&J shall be entitled...""  Our concern is that we are committing Enron entities to an agreed course of action post-merger based on speculation as to what Dynegy may or may not do.  Our suggestion would be that we simply ask F&J to delete all but the first two sentences of paragraph (5).	4.  Please note that under the terms of this proposed agreement, we are not requiring F&J to be liable for the ramp-up costs of new counsel for, e.g., the Licensing Project or the asbestosis cases (in the event that Enron Corp. cannot be dismissed from the asbestosis cases pre-trial).  We do not believe that ramp-up costs will be something F&J will agree to if we need F&J to take on the new Mariner matter.  Mariner s GC called me today to advise that it was urgent that she know today or tomorrow whether F&J was going to be able to represent Mariner on a new, critical asset-sale matter that is scheduled to close no later than December 27; otherwise, she will need to hire other counsel to handle that matter.	Please let us have your comments as soon as possible.	Britt"

In light of this, EC has a contractual obligation to a company called Risk Metrics Group.  The obligation arises out of the development and hosting by RMG of a website devoted to the use of EC s credit risk data - the site being mainly focused toward subscribers to other RMG products.  Since we are terminating the development and hosting agreement - in essence shutting down the site - we will owe RMG approximately $96,000.While I realize this is a small sum, I wanted to make sure (1) there are no approvals under the merger agreement that are required for a settlement of this nature and (2) if we are tracking this type of liability for merger purposes, that I provide the necessary information to the appropriate personnel.Please let me know if either of the above are necessary.Thanks.Mark"

She has spoken with Scott Josie, apparently one of our business people, and has been advised that the December 27 closing is critical, due to market conditions.  Theresa also believes that the December 27 date will be aggressive even for F&J, given the late date.  Theresa, please let me know if I have mischaracterized what you said.	I see two options:	1.  If you agree with me that we can t sign the letter as is:  I do my best to get an acceptable letter negotiated with Uriel Dutton today.  If I can t, Mariner retains someone else today.   Frankly, I am not optimistic about getting an acceptable letter from F&J, based on where F&J started.	2.  If you believe that we need to go ahead and get the best deal we can from F&J under the circumstances: I will do my best to get that done by noon or so, and if F&J doesn t budge, we may have to sign the letter as is.	Caveat:  I don t know if Dutton is in the office this week, so he and I may not be able to communicate quickly.  Also, if we redraft a letter, we will probably not have time to get comments back from all the other interested Enron attorneys.

172298,2001-11-21 17:20:58,"Ray, I am not sure how this reasonable and prudent request could in any way be interpreted as a threat, and therefore do not understand.  On the contrary, to sweep the accounts without the input of the Directors of these companies threatens the individuals with substantial personal liability. Further, to simply request the agreement of the three individuals who are the Directors of these companies is not onerous, and is consistent with their good faith attempts to discharge their fiduciary obligations as Directors.  Unfortunately, these fiduciary obligations do not recognize the administrative efficiencies of Enron s cash management systems.  If this remains unsatisfactory, please let me know by return. "

Theresa Bushman.  Theresa tells me that she shares the view with Mariner s GC that it would be helpful to have F&J continue to represent Mariner for the time being, given F&J s knowledge of Mariner s corporate history.  Theresa, if I have mischaracterized what you told me, please respond.	2.   Kelly Zelacovitz, Mariner s GC.  Kelly advised me recently that she has a new corporate matter of some urgency that she wants to retain F&J to handle, subject to your approval.  Kelly told me that she would be contacting you about this.	3.   Prof. John Dzienkowski of the University School of Law.   John has given me his informal thoughts over the telephone on the ethical issues, based on hypotheticals I presented to him; of course, these are not to be taken as recommendations.  In a nutshell, John thinks it would be problematic for a law firm to unilaterally withdraw from the representation of a corporate client solely and only to be able to take on more business potentially adverse to that client in the future.  John thinks it might be appropriate to ask for a disgorgement of fees paid under these circumstances.	4.  Uriel Dutton.  Dutton says that with an appropriate waiver letter, F&J would be willing to continue its representation of Enron and the Enron subsidiaries, including Mariner and the proposed new Mariner matter, conditioned on the following:	a.  F&J could not continue to represent Corp. on  one of the three IP matters, which is the nonprovisional patent application (although Dutton was not specific, I believe F&J lists it as the ""Method and System for the Determination of VAR"").	b.  F&J would continue to represent Corp. on the six or so abestosis matters in order to try and get Corp. dismissed, but with the understanding that if dismissal was not available, that new representation would be obtained by Corp. before trial.	c.  Dutton will be sending over a draft proposed waiver letter for our consideration.   We told Dutton that we anticipated getting back to him on this matter early next week.  Although Dutton will be out of the office next week, he will be reachable by cell phone.	Proposed going forward strategy:	Chuck and I suggest that if an acceptable waiver letter can be fashioned, that we proceed with proposal offered by F&J.  We invite comments.	Britt"

Byron assured me that he would stop the type of press like the article you sent.  He reiterated although that El Paso has had good success in dealing with the government in a very private way and did not want to publicise any differences that they may have with the government from time to time.  He was willing to stop the press articles that defined differences between El Paso and Enron in their approach to Brazil but had no desire to join Enron in publically trying to effectuate change in Brazil.  The meeting was very friendly.  Let me know if I can be of further help.Hope all is well with you and you and your family.

Sheila -----Original Message-----From: 	Adams, Laurel  Sent:	Thursday, November 15, 2001 4:46 PMTo:	Glover, SheilaCc:	Carrington, ClaraSubject:	Approving new counterpartiesSheila,Per Legal (Sara Shackleton) and Trading (William Stuart)  the process works as follows:Trading will call Legal and express a desire to work with a specific bank.  Legal immediately calls credit and gives the counterparty name as well as the types of trades we expect to enter into (FX, IR, long dated, spot).  Legal also puts the wheels in motion on negotiating a Master Agreement.  Credit will (or not) give it s approval for ENA to trade under a ""deemed ISDA"" format confirmation [long form which outlines credit provisions, netting, setoff, etc]  Legal then communicates back to Trading that they may (or not) begin trading with the counterparty in question.  In the most recent exampe, CSFB, Stuart called Sara to let her know they wanted to trade with CSFB.  Sara called credit and got their approval to trade using a deemed ISDA format confirmation.  Sara and CSFB negotiated the format for the Deemed ISDA, and then she gave Stuart the go-ahead to trade.  She emailed me the form of confirmation we are to use when documenting trades with CSFB.  At present, the Master Agreement is still under negotiation, but is close to execution.  Please let me know if you need any additional info."

I am especially concerned that we get moving on the curve validation and position understanding prior to the group leaving on February 28th. The following is a list of those positions: Goldman Sachs PutsThese trades have all been terminated as of December 4, 2001. We believe that there is between $31 million and $36 million of value to Enron in these transactions.  These are extremely large relative to the market and will require special attention to negotiate out of. ABN/AMRO (London) CallsThis short call position is part of the largest transaction ever executed in the weather market.  Accordingly, this is also a potentially difficult negotiation. In discussions with ABN/AMRO they have expressed a willingness to let us out of these flat and are sending me a letter to that effect.Cargill (Europe) PortfolioWe are out of the money to Cargill about $300K, but to avoid the hassle of managing the positions Cargill would just like to let us out flat.  They have been trying to reach someone to help them.Sacramento Municipal Utility District (""SMUD"") and related put optionsThe precipitation put options hedging this transaction are held by Enron Re which is going into voluntary liquidation.  The contracts with the insurance companies require that we maintain a weather station at the site.  The group responsible for managing the sites no longer exists.AIG Put OptionsThis curve needs to be validated and our value independently confirmed. Again, there are unique attributes to this transaction that should be worked out while we are still here.Enron ReIn addition to the puts held by Enron Re, we have a $4 million receivable with Enron Re.Mark."

The 99 was one of two O=regon wines on the ""2001 Wine Spectator Top 100 Wines  of the World"" list. =This wine should do at least as well.   An excellent vintage from Ribbon Ri=dge, the 2000 has a deep  saturated ruby/purple color. Ripe black cherry, c=ola, and blackberry fruit dominate the bouquet. In the background a hint of= spicy  oak can be discerned. Still youthful, this medium to full-bodied wi=ne has a layered palate, moderate tannin and a sweet, long  finish. It is a=lways difficult to compare one vintage to another, but 2000 may represent a= hypothetical blend of 1998 and 1999. It  is not as powerful, muscular or t=annic as the 1998 nor as forward, charming and accessible as the 1999. It i=s a big wine and  certainly ranks with our finest vintages to date: 1993, 1=994, 1998, and 1999.   JEAN SAYS; THIS IS GREAT WINE! 4-12 YEAR CELLARING, =A WINE TO STRETCH THE  POCKETBOOK FOR!

Copious sweet, creamy, black cherry and= berry fruit intermixed with toasty wood emerge from the wine s aromas. Med=ium to  full-bodied and fleshy, with more structure than previous vintages,= the 2000 offers the vineyard s hallmark black fruit and a  silky, lusty, h=edonistic personality. It should drink well young , and evolve nicely for a= decade. Vineyard Manager: Dick  Shea.  Beaux Freres  Belle Soeurs Temperan=ce Hill Vineyard  2000 $44.99 SALE will be $56.99 after Friday   Their firs=t offering from Temperance Hill Vineyard, located in the Eola  Hills of the= Willamette Valley. This dynamic wine possesses a saturated dark ruby color= and a sweet nose of cranberry, strawberry  and black cherry fruit. An impr=essive attack is followed by moderate yet ripe tannin. The wine reveals sed=uctive aromatics, fine  density, medium to full body, and plenty of materia=l, but it will require a year or two of cellaring in order to shed its tann=in.

I believe our employees are on information overload and putting out another newsletter adds to the overload.  I have always believed that if we have an effective Corporate newsletter we don t need these subsidiary newsletters.  Meaningful information can be included in the corporate newsletter.  At ETS we used to have periodic FYI newsletters that were directed at key topics we needed to cover.You and I also need to do a budget review.  The cost I am hearing from your group are to big for EGS to support.  I had truly hoped that Gina s group combined with you and perhaps one other person could cover EGS.

We will be using existing staff and making this additional employee communication part of our assignments.  Translations, graphics, web support and printing should collectively be under $10,000 per year. (If a subsidiary decided to copy/reproduce for their hourly employees, they would have additional costs.)Initially we would shoot for every three to four weeks, but this could change depending on interest and content.This would not replace any other newsletters, but it might result in less local writing costs or redundant news in the EGS businesses.  We expect that Enron corp. vehicles like eBiz would draw from the newsletter for some of their content for the broader Enron audience.  This may  help in getting EGS employees to see themselves as part of a team rather than assets for sale.Most of the information in the newsletter would be original. The 13,000 EGS employees can benefit from hearing from their chairman, occasional recognition and learning about other units  activities.  We plan to efficiently use our resources in developing this material, since the same effort will assist us in our necessary preparations for both external and internal audiences. We had not done the final check of the businesses and it was an oversight leaving out Brian Stanley s groups.  We will include them.Are you comfortable with the responses outlined above?   If so, we would like to proceed, but need to  ensure that the approach in the chairman s letter is acceptable to you.

The most cost-effective and timely way of doing this is through e-mail, backed up with an intranet version and hard copies (in most cases printed off locally) for those employees who do not have PCs.  The newsletter would supplement other communication channels, such as messages from you, eSpeak, floor meetings, site visits, your periodic meetings and normal management communication.  We would like to see how much news and interest we have before making a final determination, but would expect this newsletter to go out once or twice a month.  In addition to English, we intend to provide Spanish and Portuguese versions.   We will work to assist local management if they feel that other languages are needed for their operations.Attached for your review is the proposed text for the first edition.  We believe a message from you and summary of the business units/operations in EGS is the appropriate content for the first edition.  In future editions we would expect to also cover business developments and news of interest to employees.  A template of our proposed design for the newsletter is also attached.  Any comments on the text or concept, as well as your approval to proceed would be greatly appreciated.  Of course, I am available at your convenience if you want to discuss this.Thank you,John << File: EGS Chairman s Letter.doc >>  << File: EGS Asset List.doc >>  << File: newsletter template.doc >>"

Both Enron and Dynegy remain committed tothe NWN transaction.  There are no direct implications for the sale asNWN, not Enron, is the issuer of the equity in the transaction.  Thestructure of the seller financing has not changed.  Bruce DeBolt did describe the only indirect impact of Enron s currentsituation--i.e., that there are certain restrictions on Enron s abilityto transfer the securities it holds to an affiliated interest if Enron scredit rating decays to a given point.

Please let me know if you have any question, or would like to revisit the original language.BrgrdsAINYISO Credit PolicyThe NYISO has established the following creditworthiness policy to ensure that customer can meet its obligations and to protect against the risk of non-payment of invoices.  A summary of this policy is as follows:1.	To assure credit worthiness, a NYISO customer may provide a cash deposit, an unconditional and irrevocable letter of credit (from an acceptable American or Canadian Bank with A credit rating from S&P, or A2 by Moody s), or obtain corporate guarantee from its parent company for all financial obligations under the tariffs; assuming that the parent company complies with credit ratings acceptable.  The amount of the instrument equals the sum of the customer s obligations to the NYISO for three months (the greatest over a rolling 12-month period).2.	In lieu of cash deposits, letters of credit, or corporate guarantee, the customer must submit initially, and annually thereafter, a current debt-rating agency of a minimum of ""BBB"" or ""Baa2"" by SP, or Moody s respectively.  3.	Any services provided under the Tariff may be terminated either immediately (for Service Tariffs) or upon 60 days prior notice (OATT) if the customer fails to demonstrate its creditworthiness.  A NYISO customer must immediately inform the NYISO of any material change in its financial position."
189715,2001-11-12 12:46:09,"Rick - Dynegy filed at FERC to protest Com Ed s practice of letting Firm LD (""marketer or financial firm"") power qualify as a network resource and therefore be used by marketers for retail contracts.   Dynegy says this deprives them of capacity payments that they are entitled to and threatens reliability because adequate reserve margin is not being carried to serve retail load.  Dynegy believes retail load must be satisfied using Physical Firm products where specific generation is tied to the retail contract.  New Energy and Cilco are the marketers directly implicated.Enron, Cilco, New Energy, and the ICC have all intervened in support of Com Ed s practice.  Our complaint (Susan Lindberg was author) says financial firm is sufficiently, and perhaps even more, reliable than physical firm; and says Dynegy s proposal in effect would create an unneeded ICAP market.  The ICC goes on to say Dynegy s proposal would impair retail competition by discouraging entry into the retail market. Here is the Enron filing - The other case involving IP is the retail rate case where we have intervened to have IP s request for higher delivery rates dismissed.  Our argument is the legal one that their proposal favors bundled customers over unbundled customers.  It s the same argument we made in a similar Com Ed case."

But in the wake of post-agree=ment disclosures by Enron that its future earnings are likely to be substan=tially less than expected, the company s stock has been hammered. In 1 p.m.= trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday, Enron shares fell 30 cen=ts to $4.71. The stock is down 94% so far this year and far short of the pe=r-share takeover price. Dynegy shares rose 64 cents to $40.40.Although Dynegy and Enron both say they are going ahead with the deal under= the terms negotiated, Dynegy does appear to have other options. The agreem=ent with Enron contains a broad ""material adverse change"" clause as well as= some specific trigger points that could be invoked.=20Dynegy officials performed ""due diligence"" throughout the holiday weekend, =seeking to learn more about the intimate workings of Enron, which has suffe=red a series of damaging blows. Since mid-October, Enron has disclosed that= some of its officers participated in personally enriching deals that moved= assets off Enron s balance sheet, for a time, to several private partnersh=ips. Those deals are now the subject of a Securities and Exchange Commissio=n investigation. Past treatment of some of those deals has been termed an ""=accounting error"" by Enron and it twice has rejiggered its earnings since O=ct. 16. At one point, Enron restated downwards nearly five years of earning=s.=20An Enron spokeswoman said the company was proceeding in the belief that the= deal would be completed as agreed. Dynegy spokesman John Sousa said the tw=o sides are forging ahead although he acknowledged that the walk-away provi=sions ""are broad, by design, to ensure adequate protection for Dynegy share=holders."" Shareholders of both firms must still vote on the merger agreemen=t.=20Clauses related to a ""material adverse change,"" also known as a ""material a=dverse effect,"" have been the focus of much attention among merger professi=onals this year, due, in part, to the stock market s fluctuations and the e=conomic slowdown that have caused some buyers to reconsider planned acquisi=tions.=20But such clauses rarely are invoked by a buyer or seller because they are c=onsidered extremely difficult to prove. Both parties typically are reluctan=t to lay out specific terms for canceling a deal, much the way a bride and =groom often balk at negotiating a prenuptial agreement since it appears to =envisage a breakup of the marriage even before it begins.=20Furthermore, a key court case earlier this year affirmed widespread views t=hat a buyer can t easily walk away from a merger. In that case, meat-proces=sing concern Tyson Foods Inc. sought to cancel a planned acquisition of mea=t-packer IBP Inc. due to a drop in IBP s earnings and a write-down of an IB=P subsidiary. But a Delaware judge refused to let Tyson cancel the pact, sa=ying Tyson had been aware of the cyclical nature of IBP s business and the =accounting issue.=20In a lengthy June 18 opinion, Delaware Chancery Court Vice Chancellor Leo E=. Strine Jr. wrote that "" . . . the important thing is whether the company =has suffered a Material Adverse Effect in its business or results of operat=ions that is consequential to the company s earnings power over a commercia=lly reasonable period, which one would think would be measured in years rat=her than months.""=20That interpretation has created ripples in the deal-making community, promp=ting some transactions to include more details about circumstances under wh=ich deals can be terminated. Since the Sept. 11 attacks, for example, a han=dful of merger agreements have specified that future terrorist activity wou=ld qualify as a ""material adverse change,"" or MAC.=20A key issue for any firm alleging there has been a material adverse change =is ""whether the new facts go to the guts of the strategic opportunity or is= it just a hiccup,"" says Meredith Brown, co-chairman of the mergers and acq=uisitions group at law firm Debevoise & Plimpton in New York. He adds that =a court ""may be skeptical"" if Dynegy claimed that Enron s post-merger agree=ment disclosures were a surprise.=20The Enron-Dynegy merger agreement includes several triggers permitting eith=er side to seek termination. Enron can quit the deal if it receives a subst=antially better offer, although it is prohibited from soliciting one. In su=ch a case, it could be required to pay a $350 million ""topper fee"" to Dyneg=y and its co-investor, ChevronTexaco Inc.=20Dynegy can alter the deal if Enron faces ""pending or threatened"" litigation= liabilities that are ""reasonably likely"" to cost Enron $2 billion. If thos=e liabilities hit $3.5 billion ""an Enron material event will be deemed to h=ave occurred,"" presumably allowing Dynegy to call the whole thing off. In s=ome situations, Dynegy would be liable for a $350 million fee, as well.=20Karen Denne, the Enron spokeswoman, said her firm doesn t believe that loss=es arising from the normal course of business would qualify as a material e=vent. The liability must result from litigation. Currently, the company fac=es more than a dozen shareholder suits alleging breach of fiduciary duty by= officers and directors, issuing false and misleading reports and other off=enses.=20Deal makers who aren t involved in the combination say the steep drop in En=ron s stock price since the merger agreement was signed wouldn t by itself =give Dynegy the ability to cancel the pact or force Enron to renegotiate it=s terms. Instead, they say, Dynegy would likely have to prove that Enron s =worsening financial condition was an unanticipated event, which could be di=fficult in light of the company s highly publicized problems and Dynegy s f=requent statement that it clearly understands Enron s businesses. Still, th=ere is another standard clause in the merger document that would allow Dyne=gy to terminate the deal if ""any representation or warranty of Enron shall =have become untrue.""=20Other energy companies have abandoned deals following a widening gap in sto=ck prices that changed an acquisition premium. Western Resources Inc. of To=peka, Kansas last week sued Public Service Co. of New Mexico seeking hundre=ds of millions of dollars in damages after it failed to buy Western s utili=ties. The lawsuit accused Public Service of breaching its ""duty of good fai=th and fair dealing"" and said the New Mexico company tried to ""sabotage"" th=e deal as the two companies  stock prices diverged. Public Service denies t=he accusations.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Despite a $35 billion merger completed in Octobe=r, ChevronTexaco Corp. is still not one of the oil superpowers. Nor, at mor=e than $90 billion a year in revenues, is it a scrappy little guy. So Chair=man David J. O Reilly has been searching for a strategy beyond just drillin=g for more oil and gas.=20Now, he may have something: a big stake in the No. 1 energy-trading company=. Chevron Corp. has owned 26% of Dynegy Inc. since 1996, and with Dynegy s =planned acquisition of Enron Corp., the top energy trader, ChevronTexaco is= making the oil industry s most aggressive push yet into this fast-growing =business. It plans to eventually pump $2.5 billion into the combined Dynegy= and Enron to maintain its 26% stake, and it might raise that share. So, wh=ile ChevronTexaco s much bigger rivals run small in-house trading operation=s, energy trading may soon account for more than 10% of ChevronTexaco s ear=nings. ``Chevron is now positioned to be a leader in the business,   says a=nalyst Arjun Murti at Goldman, Sachs & Co.The deal would certainly dovetail with ChevronTexaco s strategy of becoming= a more integrated energy company, with a hand in everything from pumping o=il at the wellhead to trading natural-gas futures. By acquiring Texaco, Che=vron picked up, for instance, a big refining-and-marketing business --which= should balance out the bad times in oil and gas production, says Eugene No=wak, an analyst at ABN Amro. ``When crude-oil prices are down, they ll have= margin improvements on refining and marketing,   he says. O Reilly and oth=er ChevronTexaco executives declined to comment.=20Until now, Dynegy wasn t a big deal for Chevron. Chevron purchased the stak=e for $700 million when Dynegy was still called NGC Corp., and it filled th=ree of the 14 board seats--positions it will keep. Since then, Chevron has =sold nearly all its domestic natural-gas production to Dynegy. The stake ha=s been a good investment: it is now worth $3 billion, ChevronTexaco says.==20Sitting on $2.9 billion in cash as of the end of the second quarter, Chevro=nTexaco can well afford the Dynegy deal, analysts say. And they expect O Re=illy to use some of that to make more buys; the most likely target is a nat=ural-gas company. Maybe it s not so bad being No. 4.Illustration: Chart: CHEVRON S GROWING CASH HOARD=20Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

CEO Charles L. Watson if he had sat= back and gloated. After all, Watson had watched as his bigger, brasher cro=sstown rival sniffed at Dynegy s more cautious strategy, all the while garn=ering most of the credit for reshaping the energy-trading business.=20Instead, Watson picked up the phone on Oct. 24 and called Enron Chairman, C=EO, and longtime acquaintance Kenneth L. Lay to ask how he could help. Lay =didn t respond immediately, but as Enron s stock continued to plunge and th=e company faced a cash squeeze, it became clear what the only realistic ans=wer could be: Bail us out.So two days later, Lay invited Watson to his River Oaks home near downtown =Houston for breakfast to discuss a deal. Over muffins and ``a bad cup of co=ffee   the next day, Watson recalls, they sketched the outlines, and by 10 =p.m. that night, the investment bankers were called in. On Nov. 9, Dynegy a=nnounced that it would pay about $10 billion, plus the assumption of $13 bi=llion in debt, to buy Enron, which is nearly four times its size. The key t=o the deal was Dynegy s immediate $1.5 billion infusion of cash to shore up= Enron s balance sheet and save its credit rating. The money came from Dyne=gy s 26% owner, ChevronTexaco Corp.=20Without that help, Enron--the seventh-largest U.S. company, based on its $1=00 billion in sales last year--may well have faced bankruptcy. Watson says =that he never would have imagined such an outcome in his wildest dreams. ``=I don t think anybody foresaw the problems [at Enron],   he says. ``It s be=en incredible to watch.  =20Watson, 51, has to make good on what may well be his riskiest investment ye=t. If he can pull it off, the new Dynegy will have revenues of more than $2=00 billion and $90 billion in assets, including more than 22,000 megawatts =of power-generating capacity and 25,000 miles of pipeline. It would control= an estimated 20% to 25% of the energy-trading market, up from about 6% now=.=20That would be sweet vindication for Watson s strategy. Dynegy backs trading= operations with hard assets such as power plants, which allows the company= to guarantee a supply of electricity to a buyer. In contrast, Enron has wo=rked furiously to shed power plants and oil- and gas-generating fields, bel=ieving it could earn higher returns using its trading and technology expert=ise to tap assets owned by others in markets including steel, pulp, and pap=er. IRRESISTIBLE BARGAIN. As Enron s stock slid below $9 from its August, 2=000, high of $90, it became a bargain that Watson couldn t pass up. It woul=d have taken years for Dynegy to build up a market-making operation to matc=h Enron s. Its risk-management systems are top-of-the-line. Enron s commerc=ial-services unit, which manages power supplies for corporate customers suc=h as Wendy s International Inc., is three or four years ahead of Dynegy s, =says Steve Bergstrom, president of Dynegy. Watson says he still plans to ge=t rid of the $8 billion worth of assets Lay had earmarked for sale, includi=ng the Portland (Ore.) General Electric plant and oil and gas assets in Ind=ia. For the $1.5 billion, though, if the deal falls through Dynegy will hav=e the right to Enron s prized Northern Natural Gas pipeline, worth an estim=ated $2.25 billion. And Dynegy can walk away if Enron s legal liabilities e=xceed $3.5 billion.=20Watson firmly believes that Enron suffered from a crisis of confidence, not= a meltdown of its core business. Indeed, Enron s wholesale-trading operati=on earned $2.3 billion last year. Says Watson: ``We know the business. We l=ooked under the hood, and guess what? It s just as strong as we thought it =was.  =20But the trading profits were obscured in recent weeks by Enron s accounting= tricks. The biggest danger for Watson is that there are other time bombs t=icking away. Already, the company has slashed its reported earnings since 1=997 by $591 million, or 20% of its total, to account for controversial part=nerships involving Enron officials. The Securities & Exchange Commission is= still investigating. ``We believe it will take more than just a couple of =weeks and a long-term relationship [between Watson and Lay] to do all the n=ecessary due diligence,   says analyst Carol Coale of Prudential Securities= Inc. Dynegy s Bergstrom counters: ``We re pretty certain that most everyth=ing of material consideration has been disclosed.   If not? The massive ear=nings boost provides ``a high margin of error,   he says. A WANNABE. Of cou=rse, regulators may object to the concentration of trading operations. And =Watson will have to mesh two very different cultures. Enron is known for it=s intense, even cutthroat entrepreneurial spirit. Dynegy s operations are m=ore conservative; some compare it to a fraternity. Dynegy s decision to iss=ue new stock options to some Enron employees may soothe battered egos. It s=hould help, too, that Lay decided not to take the $60 million golden parach=ute he could have received in a buyout. As it is, Lay will not have a manag=ement job with the new company.=20Dynegy often seemed to be an Enron wannabe, following it into online tradin=g and commercial services. Still, Dynegy s 361% stock gains last year eclip=sed Enron s 87% rise, and it rankled some that Lay s execs got more credit.= ``Chuck Watson may not have been in the spotlight, but he has always been =at the forefront of this business,   says Bruce M.

Here s what companies should do-=-and what investors need to knowBy Nanette Byrnes and David Henry=20With Mike McNamee in Washington11/26/2001BusinessWeek76(Copyright 2001 McGraw-Hill, Inc.)In an age when giant earnings write-offs have become commonplace, it s hard= to shock Wall Street. But on Nov. 8, Enron Corp. managed to do it. After y=ears of high-octane growth that had seen earnings surge by up to 24% a year=, the Houston-based energy company acknowledged that results for the past t=hree years were actually overstated by more than a half-billion dollars. It= was confirmation of investors  worst fears. Three weeks earlier, Enron had= announced a big drop in shareholders  equity, sparking fears that its hide=ously complex financial statements were distorting its true performance. Ma=nagement pointed to a number of factors, including a dubious decision to ex=clude the results of three partnerships from its financial statements and a= billion-dollar error several years earlier that had inflated the company s= net worth.=20Enron may be an extreme example of a company whose performance fell far sho=rt of the glowing picture painted by management in its earnings releases, b=ut it is hardly alone. This year, Corporate America is expected to charge o=ff a record $125 billion, much of it for assets, investments, and inventory= that aren t worth as much as management thought (chart, page 79). Even if =companies don t go back and restate earnings, as Enron is doing, those char=ges cast doubt on the record-breaking earnings growth of the late  90s.Not since the 1930s has the quality of corporate earnings been such an issu=e--and so difficult for investors to determine. There s more at stake than =the fortunes of those who bought shares based on misleading numbers. If eve=n the most sophisticated financial minds can t figure out what a company ac=tually earns, that has implications far beyond Enron. U.S. financial market=s have a reputation for integrity that took decades to build. It has made t=he U.S. the gold standard for financial reporting and the preeminent place =to invest. It has also ensured ready access to capital for U.S. corporation=s. That a company such as Enron, a member of the Standard & Poor s 500-stoc=k index and one of the largest companies on the New York Stock Exchange, co=uld fall so far so fast shows how badly that gold standard has been tarnish=ed. ``The profession of auditing and accounting is, in fact, in crisis,   s=ays Paul A. Volcker, former chairman of the Federal Reserve and now one of =the leaders of the International Accounting Standards Board.=20Sometimes, as in the case of Enron, fuzzy numbers result from questionable =decisions in figuring net earnings. More often, though, the earnings chaos =results from a disturbing trend among companies to calculate profits in the=ir own idiosyncratic ways--and an increasing willingness among investors an=d analysts to accept those nonstandard tallies, which appear under a variet=y of names, from ``pro forma   to ``core.   (Enron offers its own such vers=ion. Before investors untangled the importance of Enron s first announcemen=t, its stock rose briefly because it told investors that its ``recurring ne=t income   had met expectations.) The resulting murk makes it difficult to =answer the most basic question in investing: What did my company earn?=20Why calculate a second set of earnings in the first place? Because the numb=ers reached by applying generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) are= woefully inadequate when it comes to giving investors a good sense of a co=mpany s prospects. Many institutional investors, most Wall Street analysts,= and even many accountants say GAAP is irrelevant. ``I don t know anyone wh=o uses GAAP net income anymore for anything,   says Lehman Brothers Inc. ac=counting expert Robert Willens. The problem is that GAAP includes a lot of =noncash charges and one-time expenses. While investors need to be aware of =those charges, they also need a number that pertains solely to the performa=nce of ongoing operations.=20That s what operating earnings are supposed to do. But because they re calc=ulated in an ad hoc manner, with each company free to use its own rules, co=mparisons between companies have become meaningless. ``No investor--certain=ly not any ordinary investor--can read these in a way that s useful,   says= Harvey L. Pitt, chairman of the Securities & Exchange Commission. The SEC =is examining whether new rules are needed to clarify financial reports and =perhaps restrict use of pro formas.=20What s badly needed is a set of rules for calculating operating earnings an=d a requirement to make clear how they relate to net income. In the end, in=vestors need two numbers--a standardized operating number and an audited ne=t-income number--and a clear explanation of how to get from one to the othe=r. ``OUT OF HAND.   A widespread consensus is building to do just that. In =early November, S&P proposed a set of rules for companies to follow when ta=llying operating earnings. Only the week before, the Financial Accounting S=tandards Board, the rulemakers for GAAP, had announced that they, too, woul=d be taking up this issue. Volcker says the International Accounting Standa=rds Board is also seeking a uniform definition of operating earnings.=20``Over the past two or three years, the use of creative earnings measures h=as grown and grown and grown to the point where it has really gotten out of= hand,   says David M. Blitzer, S&P s chief investment strategist. ``Earnin=gs are one of the key measures that anybody looks at when they re trying to= evaluate a company. If people want to use an operating-earnings measure, w=e better all know what we re looking at.  =20Without those standards in place, the gap between earnings according to gen=erally accepted accounting principles and earnings according to Wall Street= is only going to grow wider and more confusing. Look at the variance in ea=rnings per share calculated for the S&P 500 for the third quarter: It s $10=.78 according to Wall Street analysts as tallied by Thomson Financial/First= Call, $9.17 according to S&P, and $6.37 according to numbers reported to t=he SEC under GAAP. (S&P, like BusinessWeek, is owned by The McGraw-Hill Com=panies.)=20The lack of a standard measure can be costly to those who choose wrong. Use= First Call s earnings for the past four quarters and you get a relatively =modest price-earnings ratio of 23 for the S&P 500. But run the numbers usin=g GAAP earnings, and suddenly the market has a far steeper p-e of 38.=20How did we get into this mess? Investors and analysts have been calculating= operating earnings for years, and for years, reasonable people could more =or less agree on how to do it. Then came the dot-com bubble, along with inc=reased pressure from Wall Street for companies to meet their quarterly earn=ings forecasts. Suddenly, companies that hadn t turned a profit by any conv=entional measure started offering ever more inventive earnings variants. Th=ese customized pro forma calculations excluded a grab bag of expenses and a=llowed upstart companies to show a profit. ``TOWER OF BABEL.   Pro forma fo=rmulas vary wildly from company to company and even from quarter to quarter= within the same company, casting doubt on their validity. And these days, =the gulf between net earnings and pro forma earnings is wider than ever. S&=P s tallies fall between the two: S&P s numbers are more systematic than pr=o forma, but they aren t followed widely enough to be a standard. ``Investo=rs are facing a Tower of Babel,   says Robert K. Elliott, former chief of t=he American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) and a retired= KPMG partner. ``It s not standardized, and the numbers are not audited.  ==20That makes it tough to evaluate a company s performance. In the quarter end=ed on Sept. 30, Nortel Networks Corp. offered shareholders at least three e=arnings numbers to choose from. By conservative GAAP accounting, the teleco=mmunications giant lost $1.08 a share. The company also provided two possib=le pro forma options: a 68 cents loss that excluded ``special charges,   in=cluding some acquisition costs and restructuring charges, and a still bette=r 27 cents loss that further excluded $1.9 billion of ``incremental charges=,   such as writing down inventories and increasing provisions for receivab=les. Wall Street chose the rosiest one.=20Confusing? You bet. Companies defend their pro forma calculations by pointi=ng out that they re merely filling a void: Investors are clamoring for a me=asure that gives them better insight into their company s future. The goal =is to get to the core of the business and try to measure the outlook for th=ose operations. ``There are good reasons why there is an emphasis on operat=ing earnings,   says Volcker. ``It is an effort to provide some continuity =and some reflection of the underlying progress of the company.   Besides, a=s companies like to point out, they still have to report GAAP earnings, and= investors are free to ignore everything else.=20There s no starker lesson in the shortcomings of GAAP than the $50 billion =asset write-downs by JDS Uniphase Corp., the biggest charge of the year. Ne=ar the height of the telecom bull market in July, 2000, the San Jose (Calif=.) maker of fiber optics topped off a buying spree by acquiring competitor =SDL Inc. for $41 billion in stock. When the deal closed in February, its as=sets ballooned from $25 billion to $65 billion. But by then, shares of JDS =and other fiber-optics makers were collapsing. To bring its acquisitions in=to line with their new value, the company took charges of $50 billion. Desp=ite the fact that the bulk of its losses stemmed from stock transactions an=d involved no cash paid, GAAP required that the charges be taken out of net= income. So according to GAAP, JDS lost $56 billion in the fiscal year endi=ng in June--a staggering figure for a company whose revenues over the past =five years added up to only $5 billion.=20Analysts and the company argue that besides not involving cash, the charge-=off was all about the past, a right-sizing of values that had gotten out of= hand. To analyze the company s prospects, they excluded the $50 billion ch=arge. ``The accounting is not designed to make things look better but to de=scribe what happened,   says JDS Uniphase Chief Financial Officer Anthony R=. Muller, ``and we ll live with the consequences, whatever they are.   Anal=ysts make a similar defense. ``My goal is to figure out what the business i=s going to produce so that we can value the company,   says Lehman Brothers= analyst Arnab Chanda. GLACIAL PACE. Are JDS s pro forma numbers realistic-=-a fair gauge of JDS s ongoing operations? Right now, it s hard for investo=rs to judge. And that s the kind of ambiguity S&P and others would like to =eliminate. In November, S&P circulated a memo on how to standardize operati=ng earnings. Under the proposal, operating earnings would include the costs= of purchases, research and development, restructuring costs (including sev=erance), write-downs from ongoing operations, and the cost to the company o=f stock options. It would exclude merger-and-acquisition expenses, impairme=nt of goodwill, litigation settlements, and the gain or loss on the sale of= an asset.=20When S&P applied roughly that formula to JDS Uniphase, it split the differe=nce between Wall Street and GAAP. Because of differences in what each group= included in their earnings calculations, the results were chaotic. Using G=AAP, the company lost $9.39 a share. S&P figures it lost $3.19, while the c=ompany put the loss at 36 cents. Meanwhile, Wall Street says it made 2 cent=s.=20The S&P standard may make sense, but it raises the question: Where is the F=inancial Accounting Standards Board, the group in charge of GAAP? Chairman =Edmund L. Jenkins says FASB will be addressing the problems. Still, investo=rs shouldn t expect any improvement soon. The pace of change at FASB tends =to be glacial. It typically takes four years to complete a new standard. In= 1996, for example, the board realized that standards on restructuring char=ges had some big loopholes and it resolved to put the issue on its agenda. =In June, 2000, the board finally issued a draft of a new standard, asked fo=r comments, and held a public hearing. In October, 2001, the board said it =still wasn t ready to put a fix in place. Now, the recession has set off an=other wave of restructuring charges, and the FASB still doesn t have new ru=les.=20The slow pace means the standard-setters sometimes fail to react to sudden =changes in the market. The most recent failure followed the terrorist attac=ks on September 11. An FASB task force, unable to come up with a set of rul=es for separating September 11 costs from general expenses, instead told co=mpanies that the disaster could not be treated as an extraordinary item. So= GAAP earnings include costs stemming from the disaster as part of a compan=y s general performance. Many companies have nevertheless broken those cost=s out in their unaudited press releases.=20Many more are likely to do so in the fourth quarter. Indeed, 2001 is shapin=g up to be one for the record books. A poor economy and the devastating aft=ereffects of September 11 have resulted in a slew of unusual charges that a=re unlikely to recur and that no one could have foreseen. But there s a gro=wing concern that the earnings fog is providing managers with cover to hide= missteps of the past within that vast category of supposedly one-time char=ges. The temptation will be to take as big a charge as possible now, while =investors are braced for bad news. Not only can managers sweep away yesterd=ay s errors, but tomorrow s earnings will look even better.=20The basic question comes down to what constitutes a special expense--a char=ge so unusual that to include it in the earnings calculation would be to di=stort the truth about a company s performance. Usually, big charges fall in=to a few categories, including charges for laying off workers and restructu=ring a company, charges for assets that have lost value since they were pur=chased, charges for investments that have lost value, and charges for inven=tory that has become obsolete. In a recent study, Harvard Business School p=rofessor Mark T. Bradshaw found that companies are increasingly calling the=se charges unusual. That gives them a rationale for excluding them from the=ir pro forma calculations.=20Lots of critics disagree, saying such charges are often an inevitable part =of the business cycle and should be reflected in a company s earnings histo=ry. They certainly should not be ignored by investors. ``Charges are real s=hareholder wealth that s been lost,   argues David W. Tice, manager of the =Prudent Bear Fund, a mutual fund with a pessimistic bent that s up 17% so f=ar this year. ``It s money they spent on something no longer worth what it =was, a correction of past earnings, or a reserve for costs moving forward. =Whatever the reason, it s a real cost to the company, and that hurts shareh=olders.   Without standards, excessive write-offs from operating earnings c=an obscure actual performance. Without any rules, companies calculate opera=ting earnings inconsistently in order to put their companies in the best po=ssible light. Dell Computer Corp. is a good example of this ``heads I win, =tails you lose   school of accounting. For years, Dell benefited from gains= in its venture-capital investments and was happy to include those gains in= its reported earnings, where they appeared as a separate line on the incom=e statement. But this year, when those gains turned to losses, the computer= maker issued pro forma numbers that excluded that $260 million drag. Dell =spokesman Michael Maher says the company s press releases and SEC filings b=reak out investment income and give GAAP numbers as well as pro forma. ``In= our view, the numbers are reported clearly,   says Maher. ``It s all out t=here for the consuming public.   PAST PUFFERY. Many experts believe special= charges are a sign that past performance was exaggerated. What should inve=stors make of a company such as Gateway Inc.? Two restructuring charges in =the first and third quarters, minus a small extraordinary gain, totaled $1.=12 billion, or about $100 million more than the company made in 1998, 1999,= and 2000 combined. Which is the truer picture of its performance and poten=tial? The write-offs or the earnings? Write-offs for customer financing are= another example. When Nortel increased its reserves for credit extended to= customers by $767 million in September, it effectively admitted it had boo=ked sales in the past to companies that couldn t pay--in effect overstating= its performance in those earlier periods. In addition, Nortel says booking= sales and accounting for credit are unrelated issues. Tech companies blame= the sharp downturn in their industry for the big write-offs. And these are=n t isolated examples. Peter L. Bernstein, publisher of newsletter Economic=s & Portfolio Strategy, found that from 1989 to 1993, 20% of earnings vanis=hed into write-offs.=20Big charge-offs can also distort future performance. Critics contend that e=xcess reserves are often used as a sort of ``cookie jar   from which earnin=gs can be taken in future quarters to meet Wall Street s expectations. Or c=harges taken this year, for example, which is apt to be a lousy one for mos=t companies anyway, might include costs that would otherwise have been take=n in future periods. Prepaying those costs gives a big boost to later earni=ngs. Rules for figuring operating earnings would help, but this is an area =that will always involve a certain amount of judgment--and therefore invite= a certain amount of abuse. ``People are going to write off everything they= can in the next two quarters because they re having a bad year anyway,   s=ays Robert G. Atkins, a Mercer Management consultant.=20Part of the lure of big special charges is that investors tend to shrug the=m off, believing that with the bad news out in the open, the company is poi=sed for a brighter future. Since Gateway detailed its third-quarter charge =of $571 million on Oct. 18, Wall Street has bid the stock up 48%, compared =with a 6% runup for the S&P 500.=20Often, though, investors should take exactly the opposite message. If, for =example, part of a restructuring involves slashing employee training, infor=mation-technology spending, or research and development, the cuts could dep=ress future performance, says Baruch Lev, a professor of accounting at the =Stern School of Business at New York University. ``Are these really one-tim=e events?   he asks. ``Or is this the beginning of an avalanche?   Indeed, =Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co. strategist Steve Galbraith has found that =in the year following a big charge-off to earnings companies have underperf=ormed the stock market by 20 percentage points. ``LA LA LAND.   Investors a=re apt to be faced with more huge write-offs next year, even if the economy= doesn t continue to worsen. Why? The transition to a new GAAP rule that ch=anges the way companies account for goodwill--a balance-sheet asset that re=flects the amount paid for an acquisition over the net value of the tangibl=e assets. Under the new rule, companies will have to assess their propertie=s periodically and decrease their worth on the balance sheet if their value= falls. An informal survey by Financial Executives International of its mem=ber controllers and financial officers found that at least a third expect t=o take more charges.=20But figuring out the proper value of those assets is no easy task. Unless t=here is a comparable company or factory with an established market price, v=aluing them involves a lot of guesswork for which there are no firm rules. =``What this is really coming down to is corporations and their auditors com=ing up with their own tests for impairment,   says the Stern School s Profe=ssor Paul R. Brown. ``It s La La Land.  =20While the tidal wave of special charges is providing cover for earnings gam=es, it could also be an impetus for change--especially in the wake of the d=ot-com fiasco. Indeed, there are some signs of a backlash. The real estate =investment trust industry was a pioneer of engineered earnings, with its ``=funds from operations,   or FFO. But now some REITs have begun to revert to= plain old GAAP earnings. Hamid R. Moghadam, CEO of San Francisco-based AMB= Property Corp., shifted back to GAAP in 1999. ``The reason I don t like FF=O is very simple,   says Moghadam. ``One company s numbers look better than= another one s even if they had identical fundamental results.  =20There are other steps FASB could take to improve financial reporting and re=store GAAP s status. Trevor S. Harris, an accounting expert at Morgan Stanl=ey, says it could force companies to make clear distinctions between income= from operations and income from financial transactions. Lehman s Willens s=ays companies should provide more information on cash expenses and how they= bear on earnings. An easy step would be to require companies to file their= press releases with the SEC.=20At the least, says Lev, companies must clearly explain how their pro forma =numbers relate to the GAAP numbers. Otherwise, he says, investors ``see num=bers floating there, and where did they come from?   In today s environment= of unregulated pro forma calculations and supersize write-offs, no questio=n is more important to investors.High-Gloss GlossaryCompanies are using a variety of accounting practices to put the best spin =ontheir results. Here s what those terms mean:DEFINING EARNINGS:NET INCOMEThe bottom line, according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAA=P).Sometimes called ``reported earnings,   these are the numbers the Securitie=s &Exchange Commission accepts in its filings.OPERATING EARNINGSAn adjustment of net income that excludes certain costs deemed to be unrela=tedto the ongoing business. Although it sounds deceptively like a GAAP figurecalled ``operating income   (revenue minus the costs of doing business), it= isnot an audited figure.CORE EARNINGSAnother term for operating earnings. Neither core nor operating earnings ar=ecalculated according to set rules. They can include or exclude anything thepreparer wishes.PRO FORMA EARNINGSThe 1990s term for operating earnings.

The equity culture that has generated so much growth over the year=s depends on a clear answer, but getting one has become impossible. Enron C=orp. just announced that its earnings for the past three years were oversta=ted by half a billion dollars. How did one of the biggest companies on the =New York Stock Exchange manage to inflate its earnings by 20% without audit=ors, analysts, ratings agencies, and the business press (BusinessWeek inclu=ded) discovering it? In part, blame the breakdown of standardized accountin=g rules and the anarchy that runs rampant in the financial statements of Co=rporate America. The U.S. needs a new set of accounting rules that gives a =clear picture of financial performance. Without integrity in financial repo=rting, the U.S. cannot hope to remain the preeminent place to invest in the= global marketplace (page 76).=20The dot-com bubble was the first indication that there was something seriou=sly wrong with accounting standards. Companies without much of a business m=odel customized their quarterly statements to exclude a grab bag of expense=s in order to put a positive financial spin on their operations. Wall Stree=t conspired in this and encouraged big companies to join in. Soon, the meth=od of calculating earnings began to vary from company to company and even f=rom quarter to quarter within a company. It is now chaos.A stricter adherence to accounting rules won t solve the entire problem. GA=AP, the generally accepted accounting principles, allow all kinds of one-ti=me expenses and noncash charges. This obscures the performance of ongoing o=perations. No one can fathom what are true operating earnings because there= are no guidelines as to what constitutes an extraordinary expense. The res=ult is total confusion. Take earnings per share for the Standard & Poor s 5=00-stock index for the second quarter. Under Thomson Financial/First Call s=tandards, it is $11.82. But it s $9.02 according to S&P and $4.83 under GAA=P. How can investors make intelligent decisions?=20The Financial Accounting Standards Board clearly is failing to do its job. =It has promised to write a set of rules that calculates operating earnings =and relates them to net earnings, but it hasn t delivered. The rating agenc=y Standard & Poor s (owned by The McGraw-Hill Companies, as is BusinessWeek=) is doing a better job. It recently drew up a definition of ``operating ea=rnings   that includes restructuring costs (including severance), writedown=s from ongoing operations, and the cost of stock options. It excludes merge=r and acquisition expenses, litigation settlements, impairment of goodwill,= and gains or losses on asset sales. This is a beginning that FASB should b=uild on. The accounting anarchy has to end.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

But the stock market, after an initial selloff, has= shown remarkable resilience.=20Few observers expect stock-market volatility to subside soon. Still, expert=s say that now, more than ever, is the time for skittish investors to keep =their wits about them.In a recent interview, Charles R. Schwab, chairman and co-chief executive o=f Charles Schwab & Co., the San Francisco-based online and discount brokera=ge firm, gave his views on what investors should be doing -- and what mista=kes they should avoid.=20Here are some excerpts from the interview:=20In the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks, how much more risk, if any, do you thi=nk is in the financial markets? Or do you think it s just that people s per=ceptions about risk have changed?=20I ve been investing since 1959, and I have to say that, year after year, th=e risk hasn t changed. The risk is always there. There s risk in investing =in stocks, bonds and even U.S. Treasuries because of interest-rate [fluctua=tions]. There s risk in real estate, too.=20So the question is: How do you handle it? The best way is to diversify. Ove=r a long period of time, people who diversify their investments do pretty d=arned well. When they don t . . . sometimes it s fatal. If the only stock a=n investor owned was Enron . . . or Cisco at 70, that was pretty fatal.=20What do you say to people who say they re too scared to invest right now? T=hat because of the threat of terrorism, the anthrax scares, the war in Afgh=anistan, the recession, and so forth, there s just too much uncertainty in =the markets?=20I remember back during the Cuban missile crisis, we all feared the worst. W=e were all building bomb shelters. It was a scary time. This terrorist thin=g is no different. It s awful -- particularly for our children. But this co=untry is so wealthy, in terms of its resources, intellectual capital and th=e strength of our government.=20There is no more uncertainty today than in times past. For example, we ve h=ad many recessions. It s not fun, especially when you begin reading about a=ll these layoffs. In fact, I think the unemployment rate [now at 5.4%] pret=ty easily might get to 6.5% before it gets better. And it probably won t ge=t better until March or April. Also, the stock market will go up, hopefully= before the economy goes up.=20There s $2 trillion sitting in money-market accounts. That s a huge resourc=e and buying power that s definitely available for new investments.=20What do you think is the biggest mistake investors have made over the past =two or so months?=20They let their emotions take over. With the fear that people had, they didn= t use their rational thinking. They used their emotional thinking. [After =Sept. 11], they sold at the low, and fear was the driver.=20Just a year and a half ago, the driving emotion was greed. You re not going= to avoid this stuff. So the issue is how you manage through these cycles o=f fear and greed. Even when I m fearful of something, I say to myself: ""Thi=s is still the time to invest.""=20My biggest worry right now is that people will give up and say, ""I just don= t want to be in the stock market at all."" And it s just the time that peop=le should be hanging on and keeping a diversified portfolio.=20Some other mistakes: A lot of people hang on to the stock that was the post=er child of the last cycle. Or people say, ""I ll get back in [the market] w=hen I see the economy turn around."" Well, by the time they see that, it s t=oo late. They will have missed the whole ride back up.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

If you think that this is not necessary at this stage, I would like to communicate the following points:The concern of risk analytics is to ensure the following:1.	The different business activities, and the different regions are well identified and covered, yet not isolated from each other to negatively impact synergy.  2.	The suggested structure clearly identifies lines of responsibility, and accountability.3.	The above lines of responsibility, and accountability, pass through your primary support direct system (i.e., Jim Steffes); this is at least as far as the ""regulatory-intensive"" functions.    4.	Ensure that support functions (e.g. database management, regulatory research) are well connected to the different components of the Department.I am confident that you had addressed these issues, however, and  to stop beating around the bush, I  just want to discuss further point 3 above for its relative importance in the coming period.

199254,2001-11-14 07:27:19,"Another mentionThen, at an afternoon meeting of employees in the company s core natural gas and electricity trading operation, which provides by far the biggest part of Enron s profits,   quite a bit of concern was raised about the news people had been seeing about this change-of-control payment,   Mark Palmer, an Enron spokesman, said. At about 4 p.m. Central time, two senior executives who had attended the meeting, John Lavorato and Louise Kitchen, told Mr. Lay about the reaction of employees.   Ken made a decision shortly thereafter that the best thing to do would be to waive the payment altogether,   Mr. Palmer said. Even if Dynegy s directors later voted to award Mr. Lay a new severance agreement, he would turn it down, Mr. Palmer added.  -----Original Message-----From: 	Armstrong, Julie  Sent:	Wednesday, November 14, 2001 9:22 AMTo:	Lohman, TKSubject:	See about traders11/14/2001The Wall Street JournalA3(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)Enron Corp. said its chairman, Kenneth Lay, has decided to forgo a severance payment of $60.6 million that could be triggered by Dynegy Inc. s planned acquisition of Enron. Mr. Lay s decision capped a day in which he appears to have changed his mind on the matter at least twice. Early in the day, an Enron filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission laid out Mr. Lay s severance package. By midday, Enron indicated that Mr. Lay would keep only one-third of the payout, which he would take in stock in the combined company, and that he intended to donate one-third to a foundation to help displaced Enron employees. The remaining third would cover income-tax liabilities.But by the end of the day, Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said that Mr. Lay, following a meeting of Enron energy traders, had decided against taking any of the severance pay. Though Mr. Lay didn t attend the traders  meeting, senior managers told him that ""opinions were expressed that he shouldn t receive the payment,"" Mr. Palmer said. ""He decided the cleanest thing to do was to waive the payment."" The opinions of traders carry particular weight because they produce most of Enron s profits. Questions for Mr. Lay were directed to Mr. Palmer, who said he had spoken with Mr. Lay and other company officials during the day. The initial disclosure about Mr. Lay s hefty severance payment raised new questions about his willingness to sell Enron for a share price that was about a third of the market price of a month ago. Last Friday, Mr. Lay even said that Enron had other options to the Dynegy purchase, which might have allowed the energy company to remain independent, though he declined to elaborate. ""Things weren t desperate . . . we had alternatives,"" Mr. Lay said. The 59-year-old Mr. Lay won t have an executive position at the combined company, though he might be a director. For the 12 months ended Aug. 31, Mr. Lay received about $70 million through the exercise of Enron options, according to disclosure reports compiled by Thomson Financial. Last year, Mr. Lay was paid $8.3 million in salary and bonus and more than $10 million in stock awards and other compensation. Enron, the nation s largest energy trader, saw its stock collapse in recent weeks following a series of disclosures about the company s extensive dealings with partnerships run by some of its own officers. Those dealings are under investigation by the SEC. Last Friday, Enron agreed to be acquired by the far smaller Houston-based Dynegy for stock, currently valued at about $10.7 billion. The merger agreement still must be approved by regulators and shareholders of the two companies. Separately, the California Public Employees  Retirement System, which owns about three million Enron and 500,000 Dynegy shares, said it would oppose the appointment of any current Enron board member to the board of a combined company. Michael Flaherman, chair of CalPERS investment committee said that it appeared that Enron s board ""failed in its responsibility"" to monitor the activities of Enron executives. Mr. Palmer, the Enron spokesman, said Mr. Lay had provisions in his employment contract to protect him against a sudden change in control from 1989 forward. In February 2000, when Enron stock was trading between $60 and $70 a share and Mr. Lay was being widely lauded for his performance, he negotiated a bigger severance package than he had previously. Last August, when Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling quit unexpectedly, Mr. Lay assumed Mr. Skilling s duties and his contract term was extended by two years to Dec. 31, 2005. Under the terms of his contract, Mr. Lay is entitled to payment of $20.2 million for every full calendar year left on his employment contract, in the event that his employment terminates within 60 days of a change in control. Thus, Mr. Lay is entitled to three full years of payments, or $60.6 million. Mr. Lay, who took charge of the then-Houston Natural Gas Co. in 1984 when it was a regional pipeline company, wasn t the only member of his family to benefit from Enron s heady rise to a global energy giant. SEC filings show that in recent years a sister of Mr. Lay, Sharon Lay, and a son, Mark Lay, received millions of dollars in salary, commissions and bonuses related to Ms. Lay s travel agency and a paper-products company connected to the younger Mr. Lay. Mr. Palmer said it is a ""cheap shot"" to criticize the Lay family because the pertinent transactions were reported in several annual proxy statements. ""The contracts were bid out and fairly awarded,"" Mr. Palmer said. Ms. Lay said her travel agency, of which she is president and half-owner, had won its Enron business through competitive bidding and by providing ""the very best service possible."" Mark Lay couldn t be reached for comment. Coming on top of disclosures of Enron s dealings with partnerships run by its own executives, the relationships between Lay family members and the company again raise questions about Enron s willingness to keep separate corporate and personal interests. Former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow and possibly other Enron executives made millions of dollars from these partnerships. Mark Lay s dealings with Enron date back to 1994, according to the available SEC filings. In May 1997, Mark Lay and ""certain other individuals"" who together had been officers, directors or shareholders of a company called Paper & Print Management Corp., or PPMC, entered into employment agreements with an Enron unit, Enron Capital & Trade Resources, according to Enron s 1998 proxy statement. The individuals helped set up ""a clearinghouse for the purchase and sale of finished paper products,"" according to the SEC filing. Mr. Palmer said this effort formed the rudiments of Enron s profitable paper and pulp-trading business. As part of the deal, Enron agreed to reimburse PPMC $1 million for certain expenses. Mark Lay and his colleagues also agreed to ""convey"" to Enron ""certain intangible property rights"" from PPMC. Mark Lay also got a three-year employment contract from Enron as a vice president of Enron Capital & Trade. He got a signing bonus of $100,000, a minimum monthly salary of $12,500, a minimum annual bonus of $100,000 for 1997-1999 and an option to purchase 20,000 Enron shares. Mark Lay is no longer with Enron and is now attending a seminary, said Mr. Palmer. Since 1985, Sharon Lay s firm, Lay/Wittenberg Travel Agency in the Park Inc., has provided travel arrangements for employees of Enron and its predecessor company. For this work the agency received $6.8 million from 1996 through 2000. In an interview yesterday, Ms. Lay said Enron accounted for more than half of her firm s revenue in some years. She said her brother s position was ""more a problem"" than an asset since it led some to assume she hadn t worked hard enough to get Enron s business."

199600,2002-01-16 07:56:33,"FERC Approves North Baja Pipe The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Wednesday voted to approve the proposed North Baja Pipeline which will deliver 500 MMcf/d of natural gas from a connection with El Paso Natural Gas near Ehrenberg, AZ, to gas distribution systems and new power plants in northern Mexico and Southern California. The U.S. line, which is being built by PG&E Corp. s National Energy Group, would extend 80 miles to border-crossing facilities near Yuma, AZ. It is expected to cost about $146 million. The Mexican government already has issued a transportation permit to Sempra Energy International to build the 135-mile Mexican portion, Gasoducto Baja norte, to Mexicali, Baja California. FERC s approval came after the FERC staff, and the staffs of the California State Lands Commission and the Interior Department s Bureau of Land Management issued a favorable final environmental impact statement. The Commission already had issued a preliminary determination, approving all non-environmental aspects of the project. If the project ""is constructed as modified and in accordance with [North Baja  s] proposed mitigation and our recommendations, it would be an environmentally acceptable action,"" the staffs of the three agencies concluded in the final environmental impact statement (FEIS) on the pipeline (CP01-22). The pipeline could be delivering gas to the first of two new power plants in Mexicali as early as mid-summer. Work has been underway for some time on the longer, Mexican portion of the line which runs from Yuma, AZ, near the Mexican border to the Rosarito Beach area south of Tijuana in the northwest corner of Baja."
199608,2001-12-04 11:18:58,"Note:  The track record for WSI seems to have been better than the CPC for the past few winters.  Breaking News : posted Dec 4, 11:50 AMWSI Predicts Warmer-than-Normal Winter for Major Population Centers A warmer-than-normal winter is expected in the major population centers along the East Coast and Florida as well as the Southwest, while cooler-than-normal weather is predicted in the Plains, Great Lakes states, Pacific Northwest and the coastal sections of California, according to WSI Corp., which issued an end-of-November update to its seasonal forecast. For the marketplace, WSI said the winter 2001/2002 outlook ""paints a less bullish picture for the December-January period in the Northeast -- compared to last year s frigid, record cold temperatures that sent natural gas and power prices soaring."" This winter by contrast should be milder and ""much less volatile."" WSI expects the following monthly trends: December: Warmer-than-normal temperatures across the East Coast states, the Gulf Coast states and parts of the Southwest. Cooler-than-normal in the northern and central Plains and most of the western half of the country. January: Warmer-than-normal over most of the country, with the exception of the southern Plains, which includes Texas and Oklahoma. February: Sharply cooler temperatures in the northern two-thirds of the United States including the Northeast. Major cities along the California coast also will be cooler than normal. Warmer-than-normal in the Southwest, southern Plains and Southeast. ""The expectation of warmer-than-normal temperatures in the major cities in the East is different from the CPC (Climate Prediction Center) outlook, in which no forecast was made for the East,"" said Todd Crawford, WSI s seasonal forecaster. WSI was one of the few services to accurately predict a warm November in the Northeast and the United States overall, and its three-month seasonal forecasts have been accurate for seven of the last eight periods, it said. WSI issued its season weather advisories twice monthly."
199609,2001-11-14 09:02:21,"Note:  This quick expansion was the result of FERC s expedited permitting process.  Lorna   PG&E Gas Transmission Puts New Line in Service, Files 2003 Expansion PG&E Gas Transmission Northwest (GTN) already has started deliveries through a 21-mile section of its 2002 mainline expansion project, and is making significant progress on proposed future expansions. The new 21-mile pipe section put into service last Friday increases the company s ability to deliver natural gas to western markets by 42,000 Dth/d a year earlier than expected and in time for the 2001 winter heating season. ""We applaud the efforts of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to expedite the permitting process so that some of this new capacity could be in service before the winter heating season,"" said Thomas B. King, president and COO of PG&E National Energy Group s West Region, which includes subsidiary GTN. The new 42-inch pipe is in Spokane County, WA, and Kootenai County, ID, and represents the first installation of a third pipe, known as the C line, in GTN s mainline right of way. The new pipe became operational last Friday. GTN s 2002 Expansion Project also will include new 19,500 hp compressor units at five existing stations on the GTN mainline, which will increases its capacity by 220,000 Dth/d, mainly to serve power generation projects planned by Newport Northwest LLC and Calpine. Newport is developing a 1,300 MW generating plant near Wallula, WA, and two plants of similar size at other locations in the Pacific Northwest. Calpine has several generating projects in construction or development in the Pacific Northwest and California. GTN also has filed with FERC for a certificate to build a second expansion for service commencing in the fall of 2003. The proposed 2003 expansion project would add another 143,000 Dth/d beginning in the fall of 2003, plus an additional 20,000 Dth/d of winter-only service. The 2003 expansion project calls for an additional 53 miles of new C line pipe, plus the installation of one 19,500 hp compressor unit on the mainline system. Combined, the 2002 and 2003 expansion projects would put the total GTN capacity at nearly 3,100,000 Dth/d. ""The 2002 and 2003 expansion projects will provide much-needed natural gas transmission capacity to supply electric generation projects already in construction or advanced development in California and the Pacific Northwest,"" King said. In addition, GTN is exploring the possibility of building a pipeline lateral from its mainline system near Spokane, WA, to the Interstate 5 corridor near Seattle/Tacoma. The company has been in discussions with potential shippers about the Washington lateral project since an open season was completed in June 2001.  ""There is clearly market interest in this project,"" King said. ""We have successfully completed much of the initial feasibility studies for the Washington lateral project and are ready to move to development when the market indicates it is ready."" The GTN system went into service on Dec. 2, 1961, with initial capacity of 580,000 Dth/d. The original system, inaugurated as Pacific Gas Transmission Co., consisted of one 36-inch pipe, the A line. The mainline system grew over the last four decades, first through the addition of a second pipe, the B line, measuring 42-inches, and now with the beginning of the C line. The system includes 1,356 miles of pipeline along a 612-mile route which begins at the Idaho/British Columbia border, traversing through northern Idaho, southeastern Washington and central Oregon, and terminates at the Oregon/California border, where it interconnects with the Pacific Gas and Electric Co. pipeline system and Tuscarora Gas Transmission."
199611,2001-11-02 14:01:07,"Note:  Add this to the NOAA and Salomon Smith Barney forecasts.  LBWSI Sees Mild Winter in Northeast, Cold in West In contrast to forecasts by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and Salomon Smith Barney of a colder-than-normal winter in key energy consuming regions, WSI Corp. s end-of-October update to its seasonal forecast for November, December and January predicts warmer-than-normal temperatures in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and in the central and southern Plains. WSI, however, said it expects cooler-than-normal temperatures in the Gulf Coast states, Northern Plains, Great Lakes states, and all areas west of the Rocky Mountains. ""The expectation of below-normal temperatures in the north-central United States during the November-January period is similar to the Oct.18th [NOAA] outlook,"" said Todd Crawford, a WSI seasonal forecaster. ""The most significant difference in our outlooks is that we expect warmer-than-normal temperatures in the Northeast during the period while CPC is forecasting cooler-than-normal."" WSI sees the following monthly trends: In November, cooler-than-normal temperatures are expected in the western half of the United States, the Northern Plains, and Florida, while warmer-than-normal temperatures are expected across the central and southern Plains and most of the eastern United States. In December, cooler-than-normal temperatures are anticipated across much of the country, with the exception of the Southeast, New England, and parts of the Central Rockies. WSI sees numerous Arctic outbreaks to affect the northern Plains states during the month. In January, WSI forecasts warmer-than-normal temperatures across the Central and Southern Plains, central Rockies, Northeast, and Mid-Atlantic States. Cooler-than-normal temperatures are expected along the Pacific Coast, in the Southwest, Northern Rockies and Northern Plains, and in the Ohio Valley. WSI said its three-month seasonal forecasts have been accurate for seven straight periods, and nine out of the last 12. An accurate seasonal forecast is defined as one that is closer to what is actually observed versus a forecast that uses the 30-year average temperature, it said. Energy Security Analysis Inc. (ESAI) said the latest WSI forecast for milder temperatures is bearish for gas and power prices. ESAI also said, however, that in the WSCC the outlook for cooler-then-average conditions will translate into higher levels of heating demand. Due to recent poor hydro-generation conditions, power supplies in regions like the Pacific Northwest and northern California could be limited, in which case higher levels of weather-induced demand are likely to bring stronger power prices.

199612,2001-11-08 07:57:54,"UtiliCorp to Re-Acquire and Then Become Aquila UtiliCorp United announced plans to buy back the 20% of its trading and risk management arm, Aquila Inc., that it sold to the public earlier this year and adopt Aquila as its corporate name. The move is a strategic reversal apparently prompted by the weakening economy and industry changes. Executives dodged questions as to whether the move was spurred by the financial troubles at the energy industry s largest trading house, Enron Corp. On this busy Wednesday, UtiliCorp also released its earnings, and reported that it has entered into an acquisition agreement with a FirstEnergy Corp. subsidiary. UtiliCorp said its board of directors voted to make an exchange offer to acquire all of the outstanding publicly held common shares of its 80%-owned Aquila Inc. subsidiary due to the ""recent significant changes in the merchant energy sector, the general economy and the impact of these changes on the capital markets."" ""The most significant influence, however, was the realization that greater shareholder value could be obtained by recombining the financial strength of UtiliCorp with the growth opportunities that lie ahead for Aquila,"" said Richard C. Green, Jr., chairman and CEO of UtiliCorp. ""With its larger asset base, earnings potential and cash flow, the combined company will have more efficient access to capital to execute its ambitious plans. Industry-watchers questioned whether some of the spark for the recombining of the trading operation with the hard-asset backed parent, could have been prompted by Enron s current debacle. When asked during the conference call if the Enron situation factored in the decision to combine UtiliCorp and Aquila, Robert Green said, ""The decision evolved over the recent few weeks as we evaluated the opportunities in front of Aquila, and the current conditions in the capital market. [We] effectively came to the conclusion that if we are going to put Aquila in a position to execute on these opportunities, it is essential that we recombine the businesses and the balance sheets to execute on the opportunities that we see in the marketplace that are precipitated by the decline in the capital markets, and the fact that the equity markets are shutdown."" ""The merchant strategy behind Aquila s rapid growth has been a key driver behind UtiliCorp s achievement of aggressive earnings targets,"" Richard Green said. ""We decided that UtiliCorp shareholders would be better served by embracing the Aquila energy merchant strategy as the company s core strategy, rather than spinning the business off as a separate entity. To symbolize that change in thinking, we intend to adopt  Aquila  as our corporate name after our exchange offer is completed."" The company said in its conference call that it expects to complete the reacquisition of Aquila by ""early January."" Richard Green also said he will take on a new role, effective Jan. 1, 2002, initially as chairman of UtiliCorp and later of the new company that will be formed from UtiliCorp United and Aquila, Inc. Robert K. Green, president and COO of UtiliCorp, will be elevated to president and CEO of the new Aquila. UtiliCorp said all public Aquila shareholders will be offered 0.6896 shares of UtiliCorp common stock in a tax-free exchange for each outstanding share of Aquila Class A common stock. Based on yesterday s closing price of $17.99 per share for Aquila Class A common stock and $30 per share for UtiliCorp common stock, the offer represents a value of $20.69 per Class A share of Aquila and a 15% premium to yesterday s closing price of those shares. ""Aquila shareholders will have the opportunity to continue to participate in Aquila s growth through their ongoing ownership of UtiliCorp shares, and to receive cash dividends as UtiliCorp shareholders,"" Richard Green said. The offer requires that at least a majority of Aquila s publicly held Class A shares are tendered. After successful completion of the exchange offer, UtiliCorp has committed to complete a  short-form  merger of Aquila with a UtiliCorp subsidiary. In the merger, each remaining Aquila Class A share will be converted (subject to the exercise of appraisal rights) into the same number of shares of UtiliCorp common stock as are paid in the exchange offer. UtiliCorp plans to file its offering materials with the Securities and Exchange Commission and commence the exchange offer as soon as possible. ""Over the past year, I have devoted an increasing amount of time and energy to raising other chief executives  awareness of Aquila s broad capabilities,"" Richard Green said. ""We have a unique position in the emerging market that is being created by the convergence of the insurance, capital and energy businesses, combining our expertise in risk management, wholesale energy, structured financing, generation assets and other related activities. We can help clients in countless industries in ways they ve never thought of, and that opportunity is largely driving this change in executive roles."" The company also reported Wednesday that it expects to enter into an acquisition agreement with FirstEnergy Corp. under which UtiliCorp and a financial partner will purchase FirstEnergy s wholly owned Avon Energy Partners Holdings subsidiary, the holding company for Midlands Electricity plc. Midlands Electricity is the fourth-largest regional electricity company in the United Kingdom and serves 2.3 million network customers. UtiliCorp said the transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2002 after receipt of regulatory approvals. In the company s conference call, Robert Green said the acquisition would likely be ""strongly accretive"" in 2002. In releasing its earnings, UtiliCorp followed the strong third quarter results from its Aquila subsidiary and reported earnings per share for the third quarter 2001 were $0.58, up 16% from last year s third quarter after adjusting for the $0.30 gain from the 2000 initial public offering of Uecomm, Ltd. in Australia. The company posted earnings for the quarter of $68.9 million, a decrease from the $74.9 million mark for the same quarter of 2000. UtiliCorp said energy sales for the quarter were $9.3 billion, up 16% from $8 billion during the third quarter of 2000. ""At Aquila, we continue to see increasing client demand for our risk management solutions,"" said Robert Green. ""In addition, our recent capacity acquisitions are performing beyond our expectations. Our network businesses continue to help fuel our core growth in earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT). Combining that with the solid results from Aquila, UtiliCorp continues to be on track to deliver at least 15% earnings growth this year."" UtiliCorp CFO Dan Streek said during the conference call that the company expects 2001 EPS to be in the area of $2.95. The CFO added that this ""far exceeds"" the company s 15% growth target. For 2002 guidance, Streek said the combined EPS for UtiliCorp and Aquila would be around $2.92. Earnings before income taxes (EBIT) for the quarter UtiliCorp were led by strong contributions from Aquila as well as the international business segment. Aquila s operations increased from $40.8 million to $44.2 million (net of minority interests of $7.4 million) in the 2001 third quarter, marking a 26% increase. UtiliCorp attributed some of Aquila s growth to the fact that gas and power commodity markets are slowing down, forcing Aquila s clients to focus more on risk and how they can minimize exposure. As a result, Aquila has seen an increase in its client-focused businesses. Additionally, Aquila s December 2000 acquisition of interests in six power plants through its purchase of GPU International have provided stronger-than-expected operating results. The company reported that gas trading volumes in the third quarter increased 11%, from 12.1 Bcf/d during the third quarter 2000 to 13.4 Bcf/d. Power volumes increased 98%, from 44 million MWh to 87 million MWh. EBIT from international networks increased 57% to $48.5 million from $30.9 million in the 2000 third quarter, excluding last year s gain of $44 million or $.30 per share from the initial public offering of Uecomm, Ltd. The company said EBIT from Canada and Australia increased, primarily due to the full quarter contribution of electric properties in Alberta, purchased on Aug. 31, 2000, and strong performance in Australia related to continued strength in the United Energy business and the addition of AlintaGas, which was purchased in October 2000. In the United States, UtiliCorp s networks had EBIT of $47.4 million in the third quarter of 2001, compared to $45.3 million in the 2000 period. The company said the contribution from the St. Joseph Light & Power division, acquired at the end of 2000, was partially offset by higher operating costs."

201664,2001-11-14 09:02:21,"Note:  This quick expansion was the result of FERC s expedited permitting process.  Lorna   PG&E Gas Transmission Puts New Line in Service, Files 2003 Expansion PG&E Gas Transmission Northwest (GTN) already has started deliveries through a 21-mile section of its 2002 mainline expansion project, and is making significant progress on proposed future expansions. The new 21-mile pipe section put into service last Friday increases the company s ability to deliver natural gas to western markets by 42,000 Dth/d a year earlier than expected and in time for the 2001 winter heating season. ""We applaud the efforts of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to expedite the permitting process so that some of this new capacity could be in service before the winter heating season,"" said Thomas B. King, president and COO of PG&E National Energy Group s West Region, which includes subsidiary GTN. The new 42-inch pipe is in Spokane County, WA, and Kootenai County, ID, and represents the first installation of a third pipe, known as the C line, in GTN s mainline right of way. The new pipe became operational last Friday. GTN s 2002 Expansion Project also will include new 19,500 hp compressor units at five existing stations on the GTN mainline, which will increases its capacity by 220,000 Dth/d, mainly to serve power generation projects planned by Newport Northwest LLC and Calpine. Newport is developing a 1,300 MW generating plant near Wallula, WA, and two plants of similar size at other locations in the Pacific Northwest. Calpine has several generating projects in construction or development in the Pacific Northwest and California. GTN also has filed with FERC for a certificate to build a second expansion for service commencing in the fall of 2003. The proposed 2003 expansion project would add another 143,000 Dth/d beginning in the fall of 2003, plus an additional 20,000 Dth/d of winter-only service. The 2003 expansion project calls for an additional 53 miles of new C line pipe, plus the installation of one 19,500 hp compressor unit on the mainline system. Combined, the 2002 and 2003 expansion projects would put the total GTN capacity at nearly 3,100,000 Dth/d. ""The 2002 and 2003 expansion projects will provide much-needed natural gas transmission capacity to supply electric generation projects already in construction or advanced development in California and the Pacific Northwest,"" King said. In addition, GTN is exploring the possibility of building a pipeline lateral from its mainline system near Spokane, WA, to the Interstate 5 corridor near Seattle/Tacoma. The company has been in discussions with potential shippers about the Washington lateral project since an open season was completed in June 2001.  ""There is clearly market interest in this project,"" King said. ""We have successfully completed much of the initial feasibility studies for the Washington lateral project and are ready to move to development when the market indicates it is ready."" The GTN system went into service on Dec. 2, 1961, with initial capacity of 580,000 Dth/d. The original system, inaugurated as Pacific Gas Transmission Co., consisted of one 36-inch pipe, the A line. The mainline system grew over the last four decades, first through the addition of a second pipe, the B line, measuring 42-inches, and now with the beginning of the C line. The system includes 1,356 miles of pipeline along a 612-mile route which begins at the Idaho/British Columbia border, traversing through northern Idaho, southeastern Washington and central Oregon, and terminates at the Oregon/California border, where it interconnects with the Pacific Gas and Electric Co. pipeline system and Tuscarora Gas Transmission."
201786,2001-11-08 07:57:54,"UtiliCorp to Re-Acquire and Then Become Aquila UtiliCorp United announced plans to buy back the 20% of its trading and risk management arm, Aquila Inc., that it sold to the public earlier this year and adopt Aquila as its corporate name. The move is a strategic reversal apparently prompted by the weakening economy and industry changes. Executives dodged questions as to whether the move was spurred by the financial troubles at the energy industry s largest trading house, Enron Corp. On this busy Wednesday, UtiliCorp also released its earnings, and reported that it has entered into an acquisition agreement with a FirstEnergy Corp. subsidiary. UtiliCorp said its board of directors voted to make an exchange offer to acquire all of the outstanding publicly held common shares of its 80%-owned Aquila Inc. subsidiary due to the ""recent significant changes in the merchant energy sector, the general economy and the impact of these changes on the capital markets."" ""The most significant influence, however, was the realization that greater shareholder value could be obtained by recombining the financial strength of UtiliCorp with the growth opportunities that lie ahead for Aquila,"" said Richard C. Green, Jr., chairman and CEO of UtiliCorp. ""With its larger asset base, earnings potential and cash flow, the combined company will have more efficient access to capital to execute its ambitious plans. Industry-watchers questioned whether some of the spark for the recombining of the trading operation with the hard-asset backed parent, could have been prompted by Enron s current debacle. When asked during the conference call if the Enron situation factored in the decision to combine UtiliCorp and Aquila, Robert Green said, ""The decision evolved over the recent few weeks as we evaluated the opportunities in front of Aquila, and the current conditions in the capital market. [We] effectively came to the conclusion that if we are going to put Aquila in a position to execute on these opportunities, it is essential that we recombine the businesses and the balance sheets to execute on the opportunities that we see in the marketplace that are precipitated by the decline in the capital markets, and the fact that the equity markets are shutdown."" ""The merchant strategy behind Aquila s rapid growth has been a key driver behind UtiliCorp s achievement of aggressive earnings targets,"" Richard Green said. ""We decided that UtiliCorp shareholders would be better served by embracing the Aquila energy merchant strategy as the company s core strategy, rather than spinning the business off as a separate entity. To symbolize that change in thinking, we intend to adopt  Aquila  as our corporate name after our exchange offer is completed."" The company said in its conference call that it expects to complete the reacquisition of Aquila by ""early January."" Richard Green also said he will take on a new role, effective Jan. 1, 2002, initially as chairman of UtiliCorp and later of the new company that will be formed from UtiliCorp United and Aquila, Inc. Robert K. Green, president and COO of UtiliCorp, will be elevated to president and CEO of the new Aquila. UtiliCorp said all public Aquila shareholders will be offered 0.6896 shares of UtiliCorp common stock in a tax-free exchange for each outstanding share of Aquila Class A common stock. Based on yesterday s closing price of $17.99 per share for Aquila Class A common stock and $30 per share for UtiliCorp common stock, the offer represents a value of $20.69 per Class A share of Aquila and a 15% premium to yesterday s closing price of those shares. ""Aquila shareholders will have the opportunity to continue to participate in Aquila s growth through their ongoing ownership of UtiliCorp shares, and to receive cash dividends as UtiliCorp shareholders,"" Richard Green said. The offer requires that at least a majority of Aquila s publicly held Class A shares are tendered. After successful completion of the exchange offer, UtiliCorp has committed to complete a  short-form  merger of Aquila with a UtiliCorp subsidiary. In the merger, each remaining Aquila Class A share will be converted (subject to the exercise of appraisal rights) into the same number of shares of UtiliCorp common stock as are paid in the exchange offer. UtiliCorp plans to file its offering materials with the Securities and Exchange Commission and commence the exchange offer as soon as possible. ""Over the past year, I have devoted an increasing amount of time and energy to raising other chief executives  awareness of Aquila s broad capabilities,"" Richard Green said. ""We have a unique position in the emerging market that is being created by the convergence of the insurance, capital and energy businesses, combining our expertise in risk management, wholesale energy, structured financing, generation assets and other related activities. We can help clients in countless industries in ways they ve never thought of, and that opportunity is largely driving this change in executive roles."" The company also reported Wednesday that it expects to enter into an acquisition agreement with FirstEnergy Corp. under which UtiliCorp and a financial partner will purchase FirstEnergy s wholly owned Avon Energy Partners Holdings subsidiary, the holding company for Midlands Electricity plc. Midlands Electricity is the fourth-largest regional electricity company in the United Kingdom and serves 2.3 million network customers. UtiliCorp said the transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2002 after receipt of regulatory approvals. In the company s conference call, Robert Green said the acquisition would likely be ""strongly accretive"" in 2002. In releasing its earnings, UtiliCorp followed the strong third quarter results from its Aquila subsidiary and reported earnings per share for the third quarter 2001 were $0.58, up 16% from last year s third quarter after adjusting for the $0.30 gain from the 2000 initial public offering of Uecomm, Ltd. in Australia. The company posted earnings for the quarter of $68.9 million, a decrease from the $74.9 million mark for the same quarter of 2000. UtiliCorp said energy sales for the quarter were $9.3 billion, up 16% from $8 billion during the third quarter of 2000. ""At Aquila, we continue to see increasing client demand for our risk management solutions,"" said Robert Green. ""In addition, our recent capacity acquisitions are performing beyond our expectations. Our network businesses continue to help fuel our core growth in earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT). Combining that with the solid results from Aquila, UtiliCorp continues to be on track to deliver at least 15% earnings growth this year."" UtiliCorp CFO Dan Streek said during the conference call that the company expects 2001 EPS to be in the area of $2.95. The CFO added that this ""far exceeds"" the company s 15% growth target. For 2002 guidance, Streek said the combined EPS for UtiliCorp and Aquila would be around $2.92. Earnings before income taxes (EBIT) for the quarter UtiliCorp were led by strong contributions from Aquila as well as the international business segment. Aquila s operations increased from $40.8 million to $44.2 million (net of minority interests of $7.4 million) in the 2001 third quarter, marking a 26% increase. UtiliCorp attributed some of Aquila s growth to the fact that gas and power commodity markets are slowing down, forcing Aquila s clients to focus more on risk and how they can minimize exposure. As a result, Aquila has seen an increase in its client-focused businesses. Additionally, Aquila s December 2000 acquisition of interests in six power plants through its purchase of GPU International have provided stronger-than-expected operating results. The company reported that gas trading volumes in the third quarter increased 11%, from 12.1 Bcf/d during the third quarter 2000 to 13.4 Bcf/d. Power volumes increased 98%, from 44 million MWh to 87 million MWh. EBIT from international networks increased 57% to $48.5 million from $30.9 million in the 2000 third quarter, excluding last year s gain of $44 million or $.30 per share from the initial public offering of Uecomm, Ltd. The company said EBIT from Canada and Australia increased, primarily due to the full quarter contribution of electric properties in Alberta, purchased on Aug. 31, 2000, and strong performance in Australia related to continued strength in the United Energy business and the addition of AlintaGas, which was purchased in October 2000. In the United States, UtiliCorp s networks had EBIT of $47.4 million in the third quarter of 2001, compared to $45.3 million in the 2000 period. The company said the contribution from the St. Joseph Light & Power division, acquired at the end of 2000, was partially offset by higher operating costs."

As a result, =Jim Steffes will lead the U.S. Energy group along with Sue Nord, who will j=ointly report to Jim and myself.

Also reporting to Jim will be a lea=dership group for U.S. Energy that will be as follows:  Wholesale Electrici=ty will be led by Christi Nicolay; Retail Electricity and Natural Gas will =be led by Harry Kingerski; Wholesale Gas will be led by Leslie Lawner.   La=st, but not least, Jeff Dasovich and Sue Mara, who will continue to focus o=n California energy issues, will report to Jim. (Sue Mara will also be part= of the Wholesale electricity team).Steve Montovano, who will continue to report to me, will lead a commercial =development effort along with Dan Allegretti.With the elimination of the regional groups, I also recognize that there is= a need to continue to focus on how we as a group address our political/leg=islative needs across the U.S.  Paul Kaufman will lead a small group that w=ill address that need and that will focus on state political support.  Paul= will also take the lead for Government Affairs in support of corporate dev=elopment efforts across the U.S.Much of the rest of the group remains the same.  Linda Robertson will conti=nue to lead the Washington group with Sarah Novosel, who reports to Linda, =taking the lead role in our coordination of activities at FERC.  Amr Ibrahi=m will continue to lead the support of the Global Assets group and also con=tinue to manage the Risk Analytics function.  Maggy Huson will take over su=pport of the non-energy business units, which are as follows: Global Market=s, Industrial Markets, Networks, and Broadband.  Rob Hemstock will continue= to lead the support of Enron Canada.  Paul Dawson, who heads up government= affairs for Europe; Sergio Assad, who heads up government affairs for Sout=h America; and Mike Grimes and Mark Crowther, who head up our Asian efforts=, will continue to jointly report to the business units and myself.I am also forming a North American leadership group for Government Affairs =to provide policy guidance for the larger group and the company.  That Comm=ittee will consist of Rob Hemstock, Maggy Huson, Amr Ibrahim, Paul Kaufman,= Harry Kingerski, Leslie Lawner, Steve Montovano, Christi Nicolay, Sue Nord=, Sarah Novosel, Linda Robertson, Jim Steffes and myself.  We will also con=tinue to have an RCR Committee that will consist of Maggy Huson, Harry King=erski, Sue Nord, Linda Robertson, Jim Steffes & myself.  Finally, I am form=ing a Dynegy/Enron regulatory approvals working group that will consist of =Jose Bestard, Paul Dawson, Paul Kaufman, Sue Nord, Sarah Novosel and myself=.No organizational structure or set of organizational changes is either perf=ect or permanent.  I believe these changes will make us better and more pre=pared for the future.  However, we must be prepared to further adjust as th=e future unfolds for the company.One final note: I am deeply sorry that each of you has had to live through =this uncertain and troubled period for the company.  We are all saddened by= the recognition that we are in the midst of changes that will leave our gr=oup fundamentally altered, but we must resolve to do our best for each othe=r and ourselves during this period of change to ensure that what emerges, f=or those of us who do remain a part of the new Dynegy, reflects the excelle=nce and integrity that has characterized our group.

Notes     Holders of the credit-linked notes, sold by Enron Euro CLNTrust, Enron Sterling CLN Trust, and Enron CLN Trust and Trust II,may have received a higher coupon than an Enron corporateobligation offers. The notes, which are obligations of the specialpurpose entities, are tied to specific credit events, such as abankruptcy or Enron s failure to pay on obligations.     Proceeds from the notes were to be used to acquire theTrusts  initial investments, and buyers are to be paid interestfrom the proceeds of those certain assets, according to anoffering memorandum. The Trusts can invest in securities withshort-term ratings of at least ``A1   from S&P and ``P1   fromMoody s Investors Service, as long as they mature before thematurity dates of the notes.     There are four notes, each divided into two offerings, someoffered publicly and some privately sold. All the notes arescheduled to mature in August 2005 or May 2006 and were sold by agroup of banks led by Salomon Smith Barney, a unit of Citigroup.     In the event of an Enron credit event, Citibank, which actedas a swap counter-party to the trusts, can take the trusts investments in return for Enron debt obligations. The Enron debtis then liquidated by the trust, with the proceeds paid to theinvestors.     Neither Enron nor Citibank have direct obligations to theholders of the notes, according to an offering memorandum.     Enron s credit-linked notes utilize a credit-default swapthat the trusts have with Citibank that references Enron s seniorunsecured debt, so the rating on the credit-linked notes willreflect the senior unsecured rating, S&P said in a report.--Liz Goldenberg and Terence Flanagan in the New York=20Former SEC Chairman Levitt (Transcript of Interview)2001-11-07 12:52 (New York)     ****THE FOLLOWING IS AN UNOFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT.****BLOOMBERG L.P. DOES NOT GUARANTEE THE ACCURACY OF THISTRANSCRIPT.     New York, Nov. 7 (Bloomberg) -- The following is atranscript of a Bloomberg interview with Former Securitiesand Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Arthur Levitt.  Thereporter is Dylan Ratigan.     RATIGAN:  As you ve probably heard, Enron underinvestigation by the SEC, the SEC looking into partnershipsrun by their former CFO.  If you come into the Bloombergwith me, I want to show you what it s done to the stockprice here over the course of the past month, month and ahalf.  You re talking about a move from a price in the mid40s, which was not that long ago, mind you, early mid-October, to a price that is now $9.67 a share.  This hasabsolutely decimated the company s stock price.  ArthurLevitt, the former chairman of the SEC, with us, looking,first of all, at what s going on with this company.     But, before I do that, let me say good morning to you.     LEVITT:  Good morning, Dylan.     RATIGAN:  Talk to me.     LEVITT:  You know, there are certain warning signs herethat investors have to be careful of:  related partytransactions.  Anytime you see a related party transaction,an investor should be very careful.  What they were doing,was they were simply setting up these partnerships to moveoff the balance sheet acquisitions and borrowings that wouldreally have hurt the balance sheet and I think giveninvestors a very different picture.     RATIGAN:  Well, let s just make it real clear topeople, because they can easily get confused.  I m acompany.     LEVITT:  Yes.     RATIGAN:  .and I create - and I m an executive of thatcompany, and I create a partnership that has nothing to dowith that company, legally, on paper.     LEVITT:  But all the risks and rewards still belong tothe parent company.  The affect of this is the subsidiaryborrows the money to make the acquisition from anotherpartnership set up by the parent. This stays totally off thebalance sheet of the parent company.  Why does this happen?     RATIGAN:  So, in other words, Company ABC exists, theyset up Subsidiary 123.     LEVITT:  Yes.     RATIGAN:  Subsidiary company 123 borrows money from.     LEVITT:  To make an acquisition.     RATIGAN:  A bank?     LEVITT:  No.     RATIGAN:  They borrow money from who?     LEVITT:  They issue bonds.     RATIGAN:  OK.  They borrow money from the world.     LEVITT:  Yes.     RATIGAN:  . whoever wants to lend them money.     LEVITT:  Yes.     RATIGAN:  . they borrow money, they make anacquisition.  Now Subsidiary 123 down here has big debtsthat don t reflect upstairs on Company ABC?     LEVITT:  Precisely.     RATIGAN:  But ABC still gets to use the asset that wasbought by 123?     LEVITT:  Yes.     RATIGAN:  OK.     LEVITT:  Exactly.  Now, how does it happen?  Theaccounting firm that handled this transaction, ArthurAndersen, received $25 million for an audit of the company -that s a huge amount - and $27 million for consultingservices - another danger sign.  A lot of dough.  Thoseconsulting services were to validate these transactions; $52million dollars went to the accountants.  The problem hereis an audit committee was not doing its work.  If you lookat Enron s statements - and how many times have we heardthey were confusing?  It s the job of the auditing firm tosee to it that it is not confusing.  That s the realproblem.  Now, what can you do about it?     RATIGAN:  Tell me.     LEVITT:  I think, actually, the FASB, the independentstandards setter, could put through a rule, which says.     RATIGAN:  And FASB is the Federal Accounting StandardsBoard.  They set the rules.     LEVITT:  Yes.  Located in Norwalk, Connecticut.  Theycould say, if a company sets up another legal entity, andthe company retains all the risks and rewards of thatentity, then the public company, that public company thatset up these entities, must consolidate in the P&L, in thebalance sheet, all of these transactions.     Now, how does that come about?  I think the SEC couldurge the FASB to do this.  In 1990, the present chiefaccountant of the SEC called for that action to be takenplace, but at that point, the then-chief accountant didn tsupport the move.     RATIGAN:  And this creates, in your mind, a rallyingcall to reiterate that request with more venom and morepassion than before?     LEVITT:  I don t know about venom, but I.     RATIGAN:  But with passion.     LEVITT:  I certainly think that passion - I think thisis clearly a call for better disclosure.     RATIGAN:  Fair enough.  I will see you next week, OK?     LEVITT:  Good.  Nice to see you.     RATIGAN:  You, too.     ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***USA: U.S. FERC watching Enron s impact on energy markets.11/07/2001Reuters English News Service(C) Reuters Limited 2001.WASHINGTON, Nov 7 (Reuters) - The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is w=atching what effect Enron Corp. s financial problems may have on interstate= electricity and natural gas markets, FERC chairman Pat Wood said on Wednes=day.=20However, Wood said FERC does not have a direct role in the ongoing federal =investigation of the company.""We re watching the impact that Enron or any other firm would have on the o=verall workings of the market, but we re not intervening where other agenci=es have jurisdiction,"" Wood told reporters during a briefing after the agen=cy s regular meeting.=20Enron, the nation s largest trader of natural gas and electricity, is under= attack for failing to explain off-balance sheet transactions that led to a= $1.2 billion write-down of shareholder equity.=20The deals, conducted with partnerships run by ousted Chief Financial Office=r Andrew Fastow, are under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchang=e Commission.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Green-Energy Firms Seek an Outlet <http://www.latimes.com/images/standard/blackpix.gif>Power: Generators want to expand, but California continues to favor nonrenewable sources of electricity. More than a mile beneath the Imperial Valley, heat from magma boils a mixture of water, salt and minerals into a briny soup.Steel piping drilled into the desert floor taps this reservoir. The superheated liquid flashes into steam, spinning electric turbines that generate a small portion of the power that zips across Southern California Edison s massive transmission grid. The steam condenses into water and is injected back below the surface, allowing the cycle to start again.CalEnergy Co., owner of the Imperial Valley plant, wants to expand its operation to take advantage of higher wholesale electricity prices and a pending change in the way SCE pays its suppliers of renewable energy. Despite public pronouncements about the need to increase the amount of renewable energy supplies, actions by state power officials have ensured that, at least for the next few years, conventional electricity generators will be favored over renewable providers such as CalEnergy.When California began buying power this year for insolvent SCE, a subsidiary of Edison International, and bankrupt PG&E Corp. unit Pacific Gas & Electric at the height of the energy crisis, it rejected deals offered by CalEnergy and other renewable suppliers, opting instead for long-term contracts with fossil-fuel, or nonrenewable, generators, such as Dynegy Inc. and Mirant Corp.Moreover, after taking into account what the big utilities generate and purchase, the state bought more electricity than California s businesses and consumers are likely to use over the next three to four years, according to several energy experts and some state power officials.In essence, the state played it safe and went with the conventional generators at the expense of the renewables despite the promise of renewable energy s being immune to the type of natural gas price fluctuations and shortages that contributed to the crisis in the first place, according to green-energy advocates.The combination of the state s actions has left renewable generators without any way to expand. Lenders won t finance new green-power ventures if the companies don t have customers lined up. And the big utilities look to have their needs covered by their own generation, existing contracts with CalEnergy and its sister green companies and the power the state has purchased.This turn of events comes at a time when the renewable power industry--which includes wind and solar power as well as generation from geothermal, biomass and small hydroelectric projects--was on an upswing.After a slump in the mid-1990s, renewable energy generation has climbed steadily in the state, topping 24,000 gigawatt-hours last year. One gigawatt-hour can power about 750,000 homes. Encouraged by that growth, the California Energy Commission wants to increase renewable energy from 12% of the state s consumption now to 17% by 2006.One favorable development for green-energy companies in the long term is expected to be a change in how they are paid, which grew out of the way Pacific Gas & Electric and SCE plan to resolve their financial problems.Before the utilities  insolvency, payment for most renewable energy was tied to the price of natural gas, a key component of conventional electricity generation. That system was subject to huge fluctuations, depending on whether there was a shortage or surplus of natural gas, even though the fossil fuel played no role in renewable energy production.During some periods, the renewable energy companies earned just pennies per kilowatt-hour; at other times, prices were significantly higher.Now, green-energy companies will get paid about 5.4 cents a kilowatt-hour for the next five years.Green-energy producers, which according to conservative estimates make up at least a $1-billion industry in California, prefer long-term, fixed-price contracts because they provide financial stability and can be used to finance expansion and improvements, said Kelly Lloyd, chief financial officer of Enxco Inc., a Danish company that operates a wind-energy farm near Palm Springs.And lacking a potential electricity surplus, Lloyd said, establishment of fixed-price contracts for green energy in the fallout from the energy crisis should have been a positive development for the industry.""This could be a catalyst to expand,"" Lloyd said. ""But in the near term it looks like there is no room for expansion for anyone.""Marwan Masri, the California Energy Commission s manager of renewable energy, acknowledged similar concern. But he said some renewable ventures should be able move ahead.""These projects can last 20 or 30 years,"" he said, noting that the state s power purchases will peak in the next two to three years and then decline, making room for other power providers.Green-Energy Firms Seek New Contract TalksState policy still encourages renewable energy projects, Masri said, providing about $135 million a year in various incentives. The money is raised through a 30-cent monthly fee in residential electricity bills.Though the subsidies are helpful, they are of little use if the renewable companies can t find customers for their energy. That s why John White, executive director of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technology in Sacramento, would like the state to negotiate its way out of enough of the long-term power purchases to open the market to alternative power ventures.""If there is not some renegotiation of the long-term contracts the state has signed, we fear there will be a green-energy blackout,"" White said.Indeed, there already is something close to a green-energy blackout. About 96% of new energy generation in California through 2007 will be from natural gas-fired plants, according to the California Energy Commission.Although Gov. Gray Davis and S. David Freeman, chairman of the state s power authority, have in the past been friendly to green power, White said it is their appointees who have thwarted industry expansion. And this is taking place as the cost of producing renewable energy is falling.Wind power, for example, has fallen from 18 cents a kilowatt-hour in the 1980s to about 5 cents, a price competitive with other forms of electricity, said Masri of the energy commission.""Davis and Freeman talk the talk when it comes to renewable energy, but judging by the actions of the state they have not walked the walk,"" said Jonathan Weisgall, spokesman for MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co., the parent of CalEnergy.Documents obtained by the Los Angeles Times show that state power officials balked at signing renewable energy generators to long-term contracts at a time when they were negotiating with the traditional providers.In April, MidAmerican offered a 20-year contract to sell 380 megawatts of geothermal generation from the Imperial Valley for 7.5cents a kilowatt-hour. Much of the generation would have come from proposed new turbines.MidAmerican, a subsidiary of Warren Buffett s giant holding company Berkshire Hathaway Inc., lowered the price to 6.9 cents just two weeks later to be competitive with what the state was signaling it was willing to pay conventional generators under long-term contracts.MidAmerican eventually lowered the price to 6 cents and changed the lengths of the contracts and output to reduce generation by the end of 2004, near the expected peak in the state s power purchases. In each case, various state officials indicated an interest in the proposals but never followed through with a contract.Immediate Energy Need Played Role in RejectionNow, the company is looking for other customers, which are likely to be smaller municipal utilities not affected by the state s power purchases.""We are in the process of trying to expand,"" Weisgall said. ""The biggest problem is trying to find a customer.""In passing up contracts from MidAmerican and other renewable energy producers, state officials said they were focusing on electricity they could lock down quickly to stave off an expected shortage.""For what we needed at that point in time, we needed real megawatts that we could pick up and put into the system,"" said Pete Garris, acting deputy director for the California Department of Water Resources, the state s power-buying agency. ""It wasn t like we re ignoring them or saying they re not needed.""An Oct. 4 memo from Department of Water Resources Director Thomas Hannigan to Freeman illustrates the problem facing the state.Hannigan said the state has only a ""limited need"" for new sources of power and that Southern California, which is where the MidAmerican energy would have gone, ""already has excess resources.""This has left the renewable energy companies pondering their next step.The state and some of the big generators have talked about revisiting the long-term contracts. But with California officials also accusing many of the same companies of price-gouging during the height of the energy crisis, no one is predicting the outcome of those proposed talks.Another proposal would let green-energy companies supply energy to residential and small commercial customers under a new ""direct access"" plan.Direct access, in which individuals and companies contract with independent power suppliers for electricity, was intended to be a cornerstone of deregulation. But the state abandoned direct access when energy prices spiked, forcing customers to purchase power from the utilities that serve their areas. The Legislature has rejected several efforts to reestablish direct access.White is lobbying for a plan that would allow residential and small commercial customers to purchase power directly, as long as the providers are renewable energy generators.White said such a plan could help the state double the amount of renewable energy resources over 10 years to 20% of the state s requirements.But it also could add to the state s excess energy supplies by reducing demand for the power that the state has contracted to purchase. Additionally, it could slow the return of Pacific Gas & Electric and SCE to solvency. The recovery plans for both companies rely on taking the difference between their cost of producing electricity and what they can charge customers to pay off billions of dollars of debts."

The advice letterprovides the structure and operation of the PROACT, The beginning balance ofthe PROACT will consists of the unrecovered procurement related obligationas of September 1, 2001. Beginning on Sept. 1, on a monthly basis, thefollowing amounts will be recorded in the PROACT: (1) SCE s Surplus(recorded revenues minus recoverable costs); (2) all refunds related toprocurement related liabilities; (3) securitization proceeds, (4) interestexpense.The advice letter provides a detailed explanation as to how SCE s surplusand recoverable costs will be calculated.In addition, the advice letter addresses settlement rates.  SCE notes that,under the Settlement, the Commission agreed to maintain electric retailrates for retail customers at no less than the Settlement Rates during theRepayment Period.  Settlement Rates are defined in the Settlement as "" grosselectric retail rates (including surcharges)"".  In its advice letter, SCEproposes to define gross electric retail rates to mean the system averagerates. By defining it that way, the Commission can change the revenueallocation between rate groups, as well as effect some rateincreases/decreases in certain rate components as long as such revisions donot result in a change in SCE s system average rates.SCE has asked for a September 1, 2001 effective date for the advice filing.Under standard procedures, protests on the filing would be due December 4th.SCE has asked for an accelerated schedule of November 28.

I think of these words often and believe them more than ever, particularly after the events, both external and internal to Enron, of the last few months.  I do not know for sure what the next few weeks or months will bring for any of us, but I do know that what we ve done here at Enron in Government Affairs over the last several years, whether in Houston, Washington, London, Brussels, Sao Paulo, etc. was very good and will be remembered for the positive difference that we have all made in the industries in which we have worked and for each other.  We even had a good time doing it.  The good work we do will go on for many, if not, all of us . . . for some, here; for others, elsewhere.  Regardless of what the future holds, we should all be quite proud of what we have accomplished here and how it has been accomplished.

Parties have until,Wednesday, November 28th, to comment.The following are proposed implementation rules for which the UDCs seekCommission approval:1.  A  DASR can only be processed if the customer name appears on the ESPList submitted to the UDCs on October 5, 2001.2. In order to submit an ESP List the ESP must have a valid ESP/UDC ServiceAgreement as of September 20, 2001 and , for ESPs serving small customers,they must have in effect a valid Commission registration as of September 20,2001.3. For a DASR to be processed for a residential or small commercial customeraccount, the ESP must be able to demonstrate that the required third partyverification took place prior to September 20, 2001.4.  Customers should not be allowed to switch from one ESP to another afterSeptember 20 unless the new ESP had a valid ESP- customer contract in placeon or before Sept. 20th.5.  Seamless moves within a UDC s service territory will be allowed.6. For customers on bundled service as of September 20, 2001 (but stillunder a DA contract), the UDCs are proposing not to allow such customers toprocess DASRs even if their names are on the October 5 list.           7.  If all  accounts of one ESP transferred to another as a result of amerger, then the situation is okay because no new DASR would be required;requests for one customer to switch from one ESP to another only allowed ifthe new ESP-customer relationship had a contract prior to Sept. 20, 2001.8. Changes in customer identity allowed on  case by case basis (e.g., if acustomer changes its type of business it would not be allowed).9. One  customer can not transfer or assign its direct access service rightsto another.10.  Processing of DASRs submitted for customers who attempt to opt into acommunity aggregation program after the suspension date should not beallowed.In addition to the above, the UDCs proposed three additional options forimplementing the suspension.1.  The Commission should impose a DASR cut-off date (received andaccepted).2.  If the Commission does not impose a strict DASR cut off, it shouldrequire that any ESP which wishes to have a DASR processed after the cut offto submit their account specific DASR information and ESP contract to theCommission along with an explanation of why the customer is eligible toreceive DA.  The UDC will not process the DASR until it receives an okayfrom the Commission.3.

(NOK,25,f2) cut its forecast for global wireless demand for 2001 and projected a less optimistic forecast for 2002 demand than that of previous estimates by other major industry players. Earnings news was fairly sparse with Tech Data (TECD,40,f1) and K-Mart (KM,6.85) both beating the Street s estimates. Treasuries were softer ahead of today s consumer confidence data, scheduled for a 10:00 a.m. EST release.Merchandise discounter K-Mart Corp. reported a 3Q loss excluding charges of $0.25 per share, slightly better than the First Call consensus estimate for a $0.27 per share loss as the company incurred costs from re-tooling its supply-chain infrastructure. Same store sales fell 1.5%.Global IT hardware and software provider Tech Data Corp. was trading higher in premarket activity after posting 3Q profits excluding charges of $0.58 per share, ahead of the Street s $0.51 per share consensus estimate, as sales declined 19% to $4.2 billion. The company s CEO commented that, ""We continued to execute extremely well during the quarter, delivering solid results despite the weak economic conditions."" Additionally, Tech Data forecast 4Q earnings of $0.58-$0.63 per share versus the Street s $0.61 per share estimate.----------------------------------------------------------------TREASURY AND ECONOMIC SUMMARY Bonds were mixed, but generally lower as traders speculated that today s consumer confidence report may come in above analysts  expectations. Analysts per Bloomberg are expecting a November reading of 86.5 versus October s 85.5 level. Consumer confidence has been declining since June and is at its lowest level in over seven years.----------------------------------------------------------------WORLD MARKETS European markets were lower after Nokia Corp. cut its 2001 sales estimate for global handsets to 380 million from the previous 390 million forecast and said it anticipates worldwide sales of 420-440 million phones in 2002, slightly lower than Motorola s (MOT,17.96,f2) earlier 420-460 million forecast. The wireless giant expects sales to increase by 15% in 2002, with 25%-35% growth in 4Q of 2002. Earlier in the day, Bank of England Governor Sir Edward George commented that the global economy will potentially recover more quickly than expected next year and that chances of a recession in the UK are slim due to the strength in consumer spending. George said he couldn t understand the relative weakness in the euro. Nevertheless, the euro-zone currency continued lower against the dollar ahead of today s consumer confidence data in the U.S. The Bloomberg European 500 index was down 0.5% as of 8:54 a.m. EST, led by weakness in tobacco and insurance stocks while manufacturing and telecom issues were higher.The Nikkei 225 index led Asian markets lower, closing down 1.0% on weakness in communications and banking stocks after Fitch downgraded the credit ratings of several large Japanese banks, saying that the government is not in a strong enough position to support the beleaguered industry. Shares of NTT DoCoMo (NTDMY,71) fell after the wireless operator found a flaw in its high-speed wireless Internet services phones made by NEC Corp. (NIPNY,10.28) and Standard & Poor s said it may downgrade the company s credit rating on restructuring concerns. The yen was trading flat against the dollar. Crude oil got a boost after President Bush demanded that UN weapons inspectors be allowed back into Iraq, threatening oil supplies from the region.----------------------------------------------------------------FUTURES WATCH In the December Globex futures contract as of 8:54 a.m. EST, the S&P 500 index was 4 points lower (7 points below fair value), while the Nasdaq 100 index was down 8 points (12 points below fair value).

Currently, Web users pay by the minute. ""I think it will be a battle won,"" AOL France s Stephane Treppoz said, according to Dow Jones. But he does not expect much of an impact in the marketplace. Troppez, speaking at a broadband industry meeting in Montpelier, France, said, ""Users don t feel they need to move to broadband, they re satisfied with low band."" He did point out however that when flat-rate pricing was offered in the U.K. a year ago, average daily online use jumped from 20 minutes to an hour.-----------------------------------------------------------------Lycos workers ordered home for ChristmasThe almost 800 U.S.-based employees of Terra Lycos are required to take five days off between Dec. 24 and Dec. 31, either as vacation or unpaid leave.

The futures had been down earlier amid contrasting earnings forecasts and a downgrade on technology titan Microsoft Corp. (MSFT,65,f1). Biotech bellwether Amgen Inc. (AMGN,58,f1) offered optimistic sales and earnings guidance, while Analog Devices (ADI,42,f2) was more pessimistic. Treasuries fell on the jobless numbers, while bleak European economic data limited strength in the euro-zone.In equities news, Microsoft Corp. was lower in the premarket session after a Salomon Smith Barney analyst downgraded the company, citing extended valuation due to potentially overly optimistic sales forecasts for the new Xbox video-game box. The analyst blamed the current economic malaise as well as competition from Japanese video-game manufacturers for his concerns.Shares of Amgen Inc. were higher in premarket activity after the company revised its estimated earnings growth rate upward, saying that sales of its new Aranesp anemia drug and Kineret arthritis treatment will push up its earnings growth rate to 20% in 2002, on the heels of 10%-12% growth this year. The company also reaffirmed its previous targets of compound sales and earnings growth in the low 20% range for the years 2001 through 2005. Amgen said that the forecasts excluded potential profits that would be realized if either Aranesp or a longer-acting form of its current Neupogen drug were approved for use in cancer patients.Communications chipmaker Analog Devices Inc. reported fiscal 4Q profits excluding items of $0.14 per share, ahead of the lowered First Call consensus estimate of $0.12 per share. Sales for the quarter fell 47% to $423.3 million, as companies such as Nortel Networks (NT,8.07,f2) and Ericsson (ERICY,5.05,f1) curbed new orders amid sluggish demand in the telecom industry. Looking to the fiscal 1Q, ADI said that sales will likely fall 5% below 4Q, and it expects earnings to come in at the low end of the Street s estimates.----------------------------------------------------------------TREASURY AND ECONOMIC SUMMARY Treasuries retreated following this morning s better-than-expected jobless claims report. According to the Labor Department, first-time claims fell 15,000 to 427,000 for the week ended Nov. 17 from the prior week s downwardly revised 442,000 level. Analysts per Dow Jones Newswires were looking for an increase in claims to 450,000. The four-week moving average of claims fell to 454,250 and continuing claims through the week ended Nov. 10 fell to 3,734,000. The drop in initial claims reflects potential firming in the job market, but continuous claims, while improving, still remain near an 18-year high. Traders will also be looking to this morning s approximately 9:45 a.m. EST release of the University of Michigan s consumer sentiment index for further direction.----------------------------------------------------------------WORLD MARKETS A fresh eight-year low in the October German IFO business sentiment index and a European Union Commission downgrade of economic growth prospects capped gains in European bourses. The IFO index fell to a worse-than-expected 84.7 reading from September s 85.0 level, fueling speculation that Germany may not be able to avoid a recession. Adding to the worries, the European Union Commission slashed its euro-zone growth forecasts to 1.6% for 2001 and 1.3% for 2002 from previous estimates of 2.8% and 2.9%, respectively. In equities news, Dutch banking company ING Groep NV (ING,26) posted a smaller-than-expected drop in 3Q net profit to 901 million euros and reiterated full-year guidance. The euro was lower against the dollar following the German IFO report, while the Bloomberg European 500 index was up 0.2% as of 8:54 a.m. EST.Asian stocks were mixed, but Japan s Nikkei-225 index closed up 0.8% on strength in banking shares. Asahi Bank (ASIBY,7.75) reported that it disposed of a larger-than-expected amount of non-performing loans, sparking optimism that more companies in the sector may follow suit. The yen was lower against the dollar after Bank of Japan Governor Masaru Hayami intimated that injecting more money into the banking system would do little to stimulate the economy.----------------------------------------------------------------FUTURES WATCH In the December Globex futures contract as of 9:14 a.m. EST, the S&P 500 index was 1.5 points lower while the Nasdaq 100 index was down 2.5 points.

207434,2001-11-02 08:17:37,"Another wrinkle in the El Paso/CPUC Complaint case.  I ve also attached a copy of the El Paso Merchant answer to the FERC enforcement staff motion in case you re interested.NGI s Daily Gas Price Index published : November 2, 2001El Paso Seeks to Derail Further Market Power Investigation The motion by the enforcement staff of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for a ""more complete investigation"" of unused capacity on the system of El Paso Natural Gas is ""an abuse of process,"" the pipeline and its merchant energy affiliate claimed Thursday, since it comes after the case has been fully litigated. In filing a motion to strike the enforcement staff s request for the investigation, El Paso Natural Gas and El Paso Merchant Energy said the staff motion is a violation of their due process rights, since an initial decision in the case was issued three weeks ago (see Daily GPI, Oct. 10 <http://intelligencepress.com/subscribers/daily/news/d20011010c.html>). At that time Chief Administrative Law Judge Curtis Wagner Jr. recommended the dismissal of charges that El Paso and its affiliate exercised market power to drive up prices for gas transported to the border beginning in mid-2000 [RP00-241]. The judge had concluded that the complainants in the case failed to carry their burden of proof that the El Paso companies exercised market power by withholding capacity from the market. After the parties file briefs on the ALJ s decision, all that remains is a vote by the commissioners, the El Paso companies pointed out. The investigation sought by the Market Oversight and Enforcement Section (MOE) of the Office of General Counsel ""seeks to improperly shift the burden of proof by requiring El Paso and Merchant Energy to prove that they did not withhold capacity. This argument turns the Commission s adjudicatory procedures -- and its procedural safeguards -- on their head,"" the companies said. ""MOE is attempting to inappropriately influence the decision-making process in this already high profile case,"" putting the integrity of FERC s adjudicatory process in jeopardy. ""The rules under which the complaint is to be judged have become a moving target, El Paso s and Merchant Energy s due process rights and reputation have been harmed, and they have been put in the untenable position of now trying to prove a negative. MOE s improper comments should be disregarded and stricken from the record in this proceeding,"" the companies said. MOE said the issue it was raising -- whether El Paso made its unused capacity available to shippers on an IT basis, as required by FERC s open-access rule -- was neither the focus of the hearing last summer nor Wagner s initial decision (see Daily GPI, Nov. 1) <http://intelligencepress.com/subscribers/daily/news/d20011101d.html>.. MOE said its review of the public portion of the hearing record suggests that El Paso may have committed ""potential violations"" of FERC s Part 284 open-access regulations by withholding IT capacity in an attempt to keep prices up at the California border, but it said there may be ""other potential explanations"" for the existence of unused capacity on the pipeline. ""We recommend a more complete investigation of the reasons why capacity went unused on the pipeline at times during the period [of] November 2000 through March 2001."" MOE conceded its motion was an ""unusual"" move. It suggested that the Commission either direct MOE to conduct a further probe, remand the decision to Judge Wagner for consideration or use other procedures. Although ""this step is unusual, it is not unprecedented for the Commission s enforcement staff to inform the Commission of its views regarding potential violations concerning a pending proceeding,"" MOE said. El Paso pointed to a statement by the judge to back up its claim that parties in the proceeding had agreed that the pipeline was full from November through March. Here is a copy of the El Paso Merchant Energy response summarized above.

The trade deficit narrowed more than expected, owing primarily to one-time effects of insurance claims related to the Sept. 11 attacks, but had little effect on the markets. In corporate news, P&O Princess Cruises PLC (POC,18.10) and Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (RCL,15.01) revealed merger plans while office supply giant Staples (SPLS,18.66,f1) matched earnings expectations and offered upbeat guidance.P&O Princess Cruises PLC and Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. announced merger plans in an effort to address the demand slowdown for leisure cruises in the wake of September s terrorist attacks. As part of the roughly $2.89 billion agreement, each Royal Caribbean share will be worth about 3.46 shares in ""Loveboat"" owner, P&O Princess. The two cruiselines will continue to trade separately, and the deal gives a small premium to Royal Caribbean shareholders. P&O Princess shareholders will own 50.7% of the group, while Royal Caribbean shareholders will hold the remaining 49.3%.Staples Inc., the second largest office-supply retailer, said fiscal 3Q profits rose nearly 8% to $0.20 per share, matching the First Call consensus estimate, on a 1.1% rise in sales to $2.83 billion. The company credits the elimination of unprofitable merchandise and its cost-management efforts for the quarter s results, despite a slump following the September attacks. Staples says it sees fiscal 4Q results of $0.25-$0.27 per share, as compared to the Street s $0.25 per share consensus estimate.----------------------------------------------------------------TREASURY AND ECONOMIC SUMMARY Treasuries were higher but retreated a bit following this morning s U.S. trade gap numbers. The U.S. trade deficit fell sharply in September to $18.69 billion from September s $27.11 billion due primarily to anomalous effects of insurance claims related to September s attacks, which reduced services imports by $11 billion, according to the Commerce Department. Analysts per Dow Jones Newswires were expecting a narrowing in the trade deficit to $26.00 billion. Overall, imports plunged 14.0% to $95.99 billion while exports declined 8.5% to $77.29 billion.----------------------------------------------------------------WORLD MARKETS European markets were lower after the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development lowered its growth forecast for the euro-zone economy to 1.4% in 2002 from its previous 2.7% estimate in May and said more monetary easing may be warranted. Telecom service and industrial products stocks led the declining issues, while travel and leisure stocks got a boost from the Royal Caribbean, P&O Princess merger news. Credit Suisse Group (CSR,42) dropped after providing cautious 4Q guidance, even though it posted a better-than-expected 3Q net loss. The euro was higher against the dollar despite being pressured earlier following worse-than-expected Italian industrial orders and sales for September. Orders declined 6.6% on the month and 10.0% year-over-year, while sales were down 1.9% on the month and 4.7% year over year. German factory orders also declined in September. The Bloomberg European 500 index was down 1.06% as of 8:52 a.m. EST.Asian stocks were also under pressure with technology, communications and insurance stocks leading Japan s Nikkei down 1.4% at the close. The OECD predicts contractions of 0.7% and 1.0% in 2001 and 2002 respectively, before the Japanese economy expands an estimated 0.8% in 2003, noting that the Bank of Japan has little stimulative flexibility with lending rates close to zero. Nikon Corp. (NINOF,9.13) was lower after posting a huge drop in first-half profits and saying that it anticipates a full-year loss as demand for semiconductor equipment wanes. The yen was trading higher against the dollar.----------------------------------------------------------------FUTURES WATCH In the December Globex futures contract as of 8:52 a.m. EST, the S&P 500 index was 6.5 points lower (4 points below fair value) while the Nasdaq 100 index was down 16 points (8 points below fair value).

207543,2001-11-02 06:29:14,"Charles Schwab & Co., Inc.Email AlertMorning Market View(TM) for Friday, November 2, 2001as of 9:30AM ESTInformation provided by Schwab Center for Investment ResearchWEAK EMPLOYMENT DATA FAILS TO PHASE MARKETSEquity index futures were lower but climbing back from earlier losses suffered as a result of this morning s dismal employment report. The unemployment rate climbed to its highest level in almost five years as the impact of the terrorist attacks has served to prolong the economic malaise. In equities news, the Justice Department has officially agreed to a settlement in the anti-trust case against Microsoft Corp. (MSFT,62,f1).The U.S. Justice department announced that it had agreed to a settlement with Microsoft, which will be presented to the Federal Judge overseeing the case today. The accord will impose a ""broad range"" of restrictions for the company lasting for at least five years. The 18 states involved in the antitrust case have not agreed to the provisions of the settlement and are expected to ask Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly for an extension of time to review the terms.BEA Systems (BEAS,11.70,f1) reduced its 3Q and 4Q guidance after the bell last night and said that it would be forced to cut up to 10% of its staff, owing to the sluggish economy. The application server software maker said it expects 3Q earnings, excluding charges and items, of $0.05-$0.06 per share, below the First Call $0.08 per share consensus, amid lower than expected revenue. BEAS is forecasting 4Q revenue growth in the low single digits and earnings of $0.06-$0.07 per share, below the Street s mean $0.09 per share estimate.Health insurance giant Cigna Corp. (CI,72) posted 3Q profits of $1.66 per share, excluding a $33 million gain from the sale of a reinsurance business, well ahead of the First Call consensus estimate of $1.58 per share. However, the company s medical risk loss ratio rose by 1.6%, suggesting potential profit margin erosion going forward. Medical risk loss ratio is a key measure of medical cost coverage ability.----------------------------------------------------------------TREASURY AND ECONOMIC SUMMARY Treasuries were mixed after swinging wildly following the release of this morning s weaker-than-expected employment report. According to the Labor Department, the unemployment rate rose to 5.4% in October from September s 4.9% level. Analysts per Dow Jones Newswires were looking for a rate of 5.2%. Non-farm payrolls declined by 415,000, the largest one-month drop since 1980, after September s downward revision to a 213,000 decline from the previously reported 199,000 drop. Average hourly earnings rose to $14.47 from the prior month s $14.45. The services-producing sector cut 241,000 jobs, while the manufacturing industry eliminated 142,000 positions. The bleak employment situation, reflecting the economic impact of the terrorist attacks, leaves the door open for continued aggressive monetary easing.----------------------------------------------------------------WORLD MARKETS Technology stocks paced the advance in Europe on the heels of a Semiconductor Industry Association report yesterday. The report indicates that September was the third-consecutive month of a decelerating demand slowdown. However, the gains were muted somewhat by the release of a worse-than-expected German Purchasing Managers  Index report. The business index for October fell to 42.0 from September s 45.1, its seventh-consecutive month of contraction. UK insurance giant Prudential PLC (PUK,21) said that it will cut 2,100 jobs to lower expenses. Consumer staples giant Unilever (UL,29) reported better-than-expected 3Q operating profits and stuck to its guidance for at least 10% growth in fiscal year earnings. The euro was slightly higher against the U.S. dollar. The Bloomberg European 500 index was up 0.43% as of 8:53 a.m. EST.Asian stocks were mixed but mostly higher on strength in the brokerage and technology sectors. Results were mixed as semiconductor stocks got a big boost on the favorable SIA report, but electronic components maker TDK Corp. (TDK,47) posted weak fiscal first-half profits, lowered full-year guidance and warned of more job cuts amid waning demand. Although a Liberal Democratic Party panel is pushing for inflation targets in Japan, Bank of Japan Governor Masaru Hayami called the idea ""absurd,"" despite rhetoric from the BOJ Finance Minister aimed at mitigating deflationary pressures. The yen was slightly higher against the dollar.----------------------------------------------------------------FUTURES WATCH In the December Globex futures contract as of 8:53 a.m. EST, the S&P 500 index was unchanged (1 point below fair value) while the Nasdaq 100 index was also unchanged (7 points below fair value). The December DJIA futures contract was down 15 points (27 points below fair value) and the December crude oil futures traded on the NYMEX were down $0.12 at $20.27/barrel.William Johnson, Market Analyst================================================================LOGIN to access your account:https://investing.schwab.com/trading/start----------------------------------------------------------------To unsubscribe or modify your Email Alert customization options,log in using the link below or copy and paste it into your browser s address window:https://investing.schwab.com/trading/start?SANC=EAMyAlerts----------------------------------------------------------------Notice: All email sent to or from the Charles Schwab corporate email system may be retained, monitored and/or reviewed by Schwab personnel.

Retail sales for October were higher primarily reflecting aggressive incentive financing at auto dealerships.As of 11:52 a.m. EST, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.5%, while the Nasdaq was down 0.1%. The S&P 500 Index was unchanged. Retail stocks were among the best performers, while energy-related stocks led the decliners.Computer and printer maker Hewlett-Packard (HWP,22,f2) posted fiscal 4Q profits of $0.19 a share, well ahead of the First Call consensus estimate of $0.08 per share on an 18% decline in sales. The company cited strength in the performance of its imaging and services segments as well as storage and PC products, despite the continued soft computing environment. Looking ahead, HP said it sees fiscal 1Q margins and expenses to be flat with 4Q, with slightly lower revenues.Network-attached storage maker Network Appliance (NTAP,15.56,f1) reported a fiscal 2Q profit excluding charges of $0.02 a share, above the Street s breakeven forecast. Including items, Network Appliance incurred a loss of $0.03 per share on a 25% drop in sales to $194.7 million. NTAP s CEO said that he expects 3Q revenues and earnings to be sequentially flat amid a murky outlook for business demand.Shares of BEA Systems (BEAS, 16.56,f1) were nearly flat after the business software maker reported 3Q operating earnings of $0.06 per share, $0.01 higher than the First Call consensus estimate on a 2% decline in revenue. The company reiterated its 4Q EPS guidance of $0.06 - $0.07 per share and said new products were helping to drive sales. ----------------------------------------------------------------TREASURY AND ECONOMIC SUMMARYU.S. Treasuries were down, though off of lows reached in the wake of this morning s retail sales data as stocks backed off earlier highs. According to the Commerce Department, retail sales rose 7.1%, boosted by a record 26.4% jump in auto sales, amid 0% financing incentives at most of the major dealerships. September s sales figures were revised to a 2.2% decrease from the previously reported 2.4% decline. Analysts per Dow Jones Newswires were expecting an increase in October retail sales of 2.5%. Excluding autos, retail sales were up 1.0%, above the consensus forecast for a 0.4% increase on strength in clothing stores and building materials sales. Consumer spending remains the linchpin of economic growth and the strong retail sales results are somewhat impressive given the backdrop of the recent terrorist attacks, ongoing retaliatory campaign and waning employment conditions.----------------------------------------------------------------WORLD MARKETSEuropean markets gave back earlier gains and headed mostly lower in step with U.S. equity markets. Energy, gas and insurance issues led the decliners, while travel, metals and manufacturing were among the advancers. The Bloomberg 500 index was up 0.05% as of 11:52 a.m. EST. BP Plc (BP, 46) was among noteworthy energy-related decliners as oil continued to get hammered following comments from OPEC ministers stating that, without the support of non-OPEC members (mainly Russia), production cuts would not effectively boost prices. The euro, after trending lower against the dollar this morning amid a worse-than-expected 1.0% drop in October German retail sales, firmed to trade higher as traders booked profits in the greenback.Jeffrey Reeve, Market Analyst================================================================LOGIN to access your account:https://investing.schwab.com/trading/start----------------------------------------------------------------To unsubscribe or modify your Email Alert customization options,log in using the link below or copy and paste it into your browser s address window:https://investing.schwab.com/trading/start?SANC=EAMyAlerts----------------------------------------------------------------Notice: All email sent to or from the Charles Schwab corporate email system may be retained, monitored and/or reviewed by Schwab personnel.

Nielsen/NetRatings  says the volume of visitors to shopping sites the past week has increased vs the same period a year ago. ""This year s online holiday shopping season kicked off stronger than last year by increasing 14%, compared to 10% a year ago,"" said Sean Kaldor, vice president for analytical services.Visits to Web sites in the toys and games category showed an overall 65.7% rise in the week ending Nov. 11, compared to the previous week. Toysrus.com  and Lego.com were the largest gainers. Home and garden sites had a 40.5% traffic rise and 18.9% more people visited computer hardware sites.Total domestic sales online topped $1 billion last week, according to another Web analysis firm, ComScore Networks. The volume was the highest since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The increase was driven by a rebound in travel services and other non-travel categories, such as apparel, indicating early momentum in the holiday shopping season, the company said.-----------------------------------------------------------------Web users resist paying feesWeb sites counting on generating subscription revenue face big challenges finding customers. The Pew Internet & American Life Project surveyed several thousand Web users and found that while 17% of them said they have been asked to pay for access to a Web site for content, only 12% of them did so. Half said they found a free alternative, according to Lee Rainie, the Project s director. The research also found the Internet has had an impact on millions of Americans  lives. Twelve percent say they or family members have lost money investing in Internet companies, and 14% know someone laid off by an Internet company or firm that supplies services to Web companies.-----------------------------------------------------------------Credit card fraud top merchant worryMore than half the online merchants questioned in a recent survey say online credit card fraud is their primary concern as they go into the holiday season. Almost two-thirds of them are taking more precautions this year than last, including more manual checking of submitted information, according to Cybersource, which provides transaction services for retailers. Emerchants are optimistic: 54% expect their sales volume to grow an average of 37% this year from last.-----------------------------------------------------------------eBay uncorks wine salesEBay  is offering wine for sale. Chief Executive Meg Whitman made the announcement during a speech at the Comdex Computer show in Las Vegas. ""We think it s a big market, we think it s a fun market,"" she said, according to CNET. The company s Web site includes wines, wine racks and even a complete winemaking facility, with set up and training.

October housing starts reflected a softening but still robust market for new home building, though building permits data was weaker. In equities news, Philips Petroleum (P,52,f2) and Conoco Inc. (COC,25,f2) announced a strategic merger, and Dow component Alcoa Inc. (AA,38,f2) said it would eliminate jobs in a cost-cutting move. Meanwhile, U.S. Treasuries were trading higher midday and European markets were posting gains late in the session.As of 11:55 a.m. EST, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.58%, while the Nasdaq was up 0.86%. The S&P 500 Index was up 0.47%. Computer related and retail issues drove the advancers while oil and semiconductors paced the decliners.Phillips Petroleum was trading higher after it agreed to purchase rival Conoco Inc. for more than $15 billion, creating the third largest U.S. oil company. Conoco shareholders will receive 0.4677 shares of the combined company, ConocoPhillips, for each of their original shares. Additionally, Phillips  CEO said the company will eliminate jobs following the merger in an effort to reign in costs and cut duplicate positions. The companies hope to close the deal by the second half of 2002.Shares of Alcoa Inc. were higher after the Dow component announced it would cut 6,500 workers, or 4.6% of its work force, and close plants in America and Europe in an effort to reduce expenses amid declining aluminum demand. The company said it would incur 4Q charges of up to $250 million as a result of the restructuring and that the decision was designed to ""optimize Alcoa s manufacturing system after a recent series of acquisitions.""Lowe s Companies (LOW,42) got a lift after it posted a 24% rise in fiscal 3Q net income to $0.32 per share, $0.01 ahead of the First Call $0.31 per share consensus forecast. Sales rose 21% to $5.45 billion, with same-store sales rising 4%. The company s CEO noted strength in all product categories across every geographic region, saying consumer traffic accelerated during the quarter. Lowe s expects fiscal 2002 profits of $1.24-$1.25 per share, ahead of the Street s $1.23 mean estimate.----------------------------------------------------------------TREASURY AND ECONOMIC SUMMARYTreasuries were higher midday, recouping some of last week s sharp losses, despite the stronger-than-expected housing starts data. Total starts for October fell 1.3% to a 1.552 million unit annual rate from September s revised 1.572 million unit pace. Analysts were expecting a 4.7% decline to a 1.500 million unit annual rate. Weakness was most noticeable in the West. Despite the unexpected resiliency in the housing market, buoyed by historically low interest rates, the more forward-looking building permits fell 3.6% in October, roughly matching expectations, on the heels of a revised 2.7% decline the prior month. Permits were previously reported as having dropped 3.0% in September.----------------------------------------------------------------WORLD MARKETSEuropean markets were higher later in the day, despite a Bundesbank report reflecting sequentially flat 3Q German economic growth and a potentially weaker 4Q. Optimism that lower interest rates and falling crude prices will eventually stimulate economic expansion helped boost the Bloomberg 500 index, which was up 1.24% as of 11:55 a.m. EST. Telecoms and financials paced the advancers, while pharmaceuticals and foods led the decliners. In equities news, Microsoft Corp. (MSFT,66,f1) formally responded to European Union charges that it violated anti-trust laws in a written rebuttal addressing the Commission s objections. The euro was down against the U.S. dollar following weekend comments from hawkish European Central Bank officials hinting that they may not reduce euro-zone interest rates further. Crude oil was lower amid renewed concerns that Russia will offer nothing more in the way of OPEC concessions than a meager, symbolic production cut.Jeffrey Reeve, Market Analyst================================================================LOGIN to access your account:https://investing.schwab.com/trading/start----------------------------------------------------------------To unsubscribe or modify your Email Alert customization options,log in using the link below or copy and paste it into your browser s address window:https://investing.schwab.com/trading/start?SANC=EAMyAlerts----------------------------------------------------------------Notice: All email sent to or from the Charles Schwab corporate email system may be retained, monitored and/or reviewed by Schwab personnel.

""It means women think of the Internet in a much more serious way."" Last year, online shoppers were even split between men and women. For women, a major attraction of online shopping is its time-saving efficiency, Rainie said.AOL Time Warner s AOL found a  trend among its shoppers. ""Overall, females accounted for 64% of all shopping, underscoring the extent to which AOL s shopping audience is paralleling offline retailing and making online buying a habit,"" the company said in a release. AOL added its members spent $33 billion online during 2001, an increase of 67% from the prior year s levels.-----------------------------------------------------------------Online job sites frustrateThere s a whole lot of lookin  going on, but not much hiring. That s the complaint of many users of online job sites, such as Hotjobs.com and Monster.com, according to The Wall Street Journal, which cites the experience of a 37-year-old Indiana woman as a representative example. Grace Dubois spends five hours a day searching through job boards. She has applied for nearly 400 positions in the health-care industry; seven have resulted in job interviews.Her experience is supported by research, the newspaper reported. Outplacement consultants Drake Beam Morin said Internet job resources account for only 6% of management-level job hiring. CareerXroads, a consulting company that publishes an annual guide to job boards, found corporate Web sites are the most effective resources for job seekers.The biggest complaint from users of CareerJournal, the job site operated by the Journal, is there are not enough listings. There are about 23,000 jobs posted, down from 35,000 a year ago. Any failure to follow up with applicants is the fault of employers, not employment sites, Dimitri Boylan, president of Hotjobs.com -- soon to be acquired by Yahoo -- told The Journal.-----------------------------------------------------------------AOL blocks Harvard acceptance emailsAmerica Online cannot explain why it blocked delivery of about 100 emails to applicants from Harvard University s admissions office.

""Shutdowns followed on the heels of the stock-market downturn as venture investors, watching their exit opportunities dissolve, abruptly shut their doors on cash-hungry startups,"" Miller said. He said that the slowdown is not due to the fact there are so few dot-coms left. Webmergers.com estimates between 7,000 and 10,000 Internet companies received some sort of funding.

Sales volume during the period running from Thanksgiving to Christmas Eve was up 86% compared to the same period last year, said Rob Solomon, vice president and general manager of Yahoo Shopping. He said bargain hunting was a major driver this season -- and one to which his site is catering after Christmas. Yahoo launched a post-holiday sales center Wednesday morning, through which it will offer discounts of 50% to 75% on items from Banana Republic, Old Navy and SonyStyle. Yahoo will also open an Unwanted Gifts showcase on its auction site. ""Consumers can auction off their undesirable gifts and shop for products they really want,"" Solomon said.Separately, comparison shopping site BizRate.com s estimate of online shopping was similar to Yahoo s. During the weekend before Christmas, online shopping transactions were valued at $345 million, a gain of 73% compared to last year, BizRate.com said. Another interesting factoid: 52% of the shoppers were men.Meanwhile, Terra Lycos said results of its online shopping season confirmed early predictions that bargain hunting would be in the forefront of consumers  minds were right on target. ""The tone and attitude of this season was different,"" said Kim Kluck, group product manager for Lycos Shopping. Moreover, she said there was plenty of evidence of cocooning. ""The values of giving and gathering, or keeping family close together and safe at the holidays, emerged early,"" she said.-----------------------------------------------------------------Media Metrix makes accuracy revisionsWeb audience-measurement company Jupiter Media Metrix has decided to separately report Web site visits generated by pop-up, pop-under and other ""involuntary"" means. Previously, the company s listings of Web properties included sites that use such advertising techniques. The decision to include such traffic in a new ""promotional servers"" category reflects adaptation to ""the evolving Internet landscape and industry s needs,"" Media Metrix said. Sites in this category will not appear in any of the company s other measured categories, but it will include sites that sell email lists, opt-in email providers, image servers and promotional links.Media Metrix also said it would include elements of major portal sites in its popularity ranking of Web sites by category of content. This means traffic to the personal-finance, real-estate and travel portions of AOL Time Warner s America Online, Microsoft Corp. s MSN, Yahoo  and others will be reported as if they were stand-alone properties in those categories. The reason to do this, said Will Hodgman, president of the company s measurement business, is demonstrated by the finding that AOL properties ranked among the top 10 in 37 categories, while Microsoft and MSN-branded components were in the top 10 in 30 categories, and Yahoo s placed in 10 of the top 30 as well. ""This will provide the most accurate snapshot and reliable performance metrics to meet the needs of all companies with a stake online,"" he said.-----------------------------------------------------------------For late-breaking market news you can t afford to miss, go tohttp://CBS.MarketWatch.com/================================================================LOGIN to access your account:https://investing.schwab.com/trading/start----------------------------------------------------------------To unsubscribe or modify your Email Alert customization options,log in using the link below or copy and paste it into your browser s address window:https://investing.schwab.com/trading/start?SANC=EAMyAlerts----------------------------------------------------------------Notice: All email sent to or from the Charles Schwab corporate email system may be retained, monitored and/or reviewed by Schwab personnel.

Apple Computer (AAPL,22,f1) said its retail outlets may report a loss in 2002 and TMP Worldwide (TMPW,42,f1) stated it would not boost its offer for Hotjobs.com (HOTJ,10.67,f1). U.S. Treasuries are flat and world markets are higher.TMP Worldwide, provider of the popular Monster.com web site, reported that it would not increase its bid for competitor Hotjobs.com, saying it had offered ""full and fair value"" for the entity. Hotjobs announced on Monday that it would accept a $436 million offer from rival bidder Yahoo! (YHOO,17.51,f1) if TMP did not increase its proposal, which has shrunk since June given declines in TMP s stock. If the acquisition fails, TMP is entitled to as much as $17 million in termination and reimbursement fees from Hotjobs and the company would remain the No. 1 online recruitment site.Apple Computer said it now expects its retail stores to incur a loss in 2002, contrary to forecasts made last May predicting retail profitability for the year ending in fiscal 2002.

Consumer confidence, new home sales and initial jobless claims came in higher than expected. U.S. Treasuries are lower and European markets are higher.As of 11:49 a.m. EST, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.1%, while the Nasdaq Composite Index is 0.4% higher. The S&P 500 Index is up 0.1%. Biotech, airline and energy shares are pacing the advancers while consumer products and transportation issues are leading the decliners.Shares of Allegheny Energy (AYE,35) are lower following news that it anticipates earnings of $3.60-$3.70 per share in 2001 and flat 2002 profits, lower than the First Call consensus of $3.90 per share and $4.15 per share, respectively.Chip equipment provider Nanometrics Inc. (NANO,21,f1) is down after saying it sees 4Q sales falling 25% from 3Q levels, worse than its previous flat 4Q forecast, as a result of the slowing economy and excess inventories among its customers.----------------------------------------------------------------TREASURY AND ECONOMIC SUMMARYU.S. Treasury prices are lower at the long-end following the release of this morning s stronger-than-expected economic data. In positive economic news, the Conference Board s index of consumer confidence rose to 93.7 in December, much better than Bloomberg s 83.0 estimate and November s revised 84.9 reading. The present situation index, which evaluates current economic conditions, increased to 96.9 from 96.2 while the forward-looking future expectations index jumped noticeably from 77.3 in November to 91.5 in December. Overall, the report reflects a significant boost in consumer optimism regarding the U.S. economy.The Chicago Purchasing Managers  Index, a precursor to the National Association of Purchasing Management index to be released Monday, rose to 41.4 in December, well below the 45.0 estimate per Bloomberg but higher than November s 41.1 reading. The index indicates contraction in the region s manufacturing sector at a slightly slower rate than in November. The new orders index rose to 43.9 from 41.4 while the inventories component fell to 33.8 from 36.3, suggesting inventory depletion will eventually lead to new production. The prices paid sub-index rose to 46.8 from November s 40.1.In a sign of continued resiliency in the housing markets, new home sales for November rose 6.4% to 934,000, better than the 880,000 level expected per Dow Jones Newswires. The supply of new homes fell to 4.0 months from October s 4.3 months. November existing home sales increased 0.6% to a 5.21 million unit annual rate, slightly higher than the 5.16 million unit rate analysts were expecting per Bloomberg.Initial jobless claims for the week ended Dec. 22 increased by 7,000 to 392,000. Analysts were expecting an increase to 400,000 according to Dow Jones Newswires. The four-week moving average of claims fell to 413,250 from 438,500 while continuing claims for the week ended Dec. 15 rose 23,000 to 3,700,000.Durable goods orders for November declined 4.8%, slightly less than the 5.0% decrease expected per Dow Jones Newswires. October durable goods orders were revised lower to a 12.5% increase from the 12.7% rise previously reported. Excluding a 69.8% drop in defense orders following October s joint strike fighter contract, durable goods orders increased 2.7%. Orders excluding transportation rose 1.1% as aircraft and aircraft parts orders fell 57.9%.----------------------------------------------------------------WORLD MARKETSEuropean markets are higher with the Bloomberg European 500 index up 1.3% as of 11:49 a.m. EST, led by technology-related shares. In economic news, French unemployment rose to 9% in November, the highest level in a year. The euro-zone M3 money supply grew at an 8% rate in November, potentially reducing chances for European Central Bank interest-rate cuts. Marking the first time a foreign commercial bank will own part of a mainland Chinese bank, European lender HSBC Plc (HBCYF,11.5) announced it intends to purchase an 8% stake in the Bank of Shanghai. The euro is trading slightly lower versus the U.S. dollar.

The number of visitors to sites surveyed by the company last week, 52.3 million, was 55% greater than the number last year, said Charles Buchwalter of Jupiter. By contrast, year-over-year growth rates declined each week last year as the holiday neared. That has not been the case this year. ""That translates into a holiday season where the majority of online shopping activity occurs closer to Christmas,"" he said. ""Many consumers waited until late in the holiday season to make their gift purchases, and many were searching for late-season discounts,"" said Jared Blank, another Jupiter Research analyst. He also said consumers have increased confidence about online sites  ability to deliver merchandise quickly.-----------------------------------------------------------------Web draws ""Spiderman"" fansOn the heels of this week s report that half of all online shopping occurs at work, office PCs are also turning out to be terrific movie preview theaters.

232678,2001-11-27 15:41:26,"	Bob and I just spoke with Steve Susman.  I tried to mention the points you asked.  Here are his comments:	1.  F&J probably could not simply send us our files back and put itself in a position to be adverse to us with Arthur Anderson.  Susman believes that there is a ""hot potato"" rule that prevents F&J from doing so.	2.  That being said, Susman doesn t care if F&J represents Arthur Anderson or anyone else potentially adverse to us in the actions he is handling. 	3.  Susman would not, however, agree to a broad advance ethical waiver, as proposed by F&J.  He does not believe such waivers are effective.  Susman would agree to a waiver once we were advised who F&J wanted to represent.  I don t know whether F&J would agree to this or not. 	4.  Susman recognizes that we cannot force F&J to take on the new Mariner matter, and that this is ultimately a risk/benefit decision for us to make, and that we may have to agree to terms that we otherwise wouldn t agree to. 	Parenthetically, I have received no comments on F&J s proposed waiver letter.	Under the circumstances, from his standpoint, Bob is inclined for us to get the best deal on the waiver letter that we can with F&J, but that if F&J won t budge, that we take something along the lines of what they have given us (Bob, let me know if I have mischaracterized your thoughts).  	From my standpoint, I unfortunately think there are some parts of the letter that we must have changed.  This would be to the extent that the letter purports to have Enron Corp. agree to bind all the Enron entities, and to the extent that it involves Enron s agreement to what will happen after the Dynegy merger (as I set out in my earlier e-mail).  My recommendation would be, as set forth in my earlier e-mail, that only the Enron entities currently being represented by F&J sign it and be bound by it, and to remove the language regarding what Enron would agree to after the Dynegy merger.  I also find the advance ethical waiver language repugnant, but could agree to it if the other modifications mentioned could be made.  I do not know whether F&J would be willing to make these changes or not.	Our biggest problem right now is time-management.  I know that Mariner wanted to make a decision by today as to who to use.  I am willing to confer with Dutton ASAP to see what F&J would agree to, and if he can agree in principle, to send him a proposed draft agreement.  I believe he is out of the office but is checking his voice-mail.  	Please let me know what you want me to do.	Britt"

I reviewed a voice-mail from Theresa Bushman this morning about the timing on the new Mariner matter that Mariner for which Mariner would like to retain F&J.  She has spoken with Scott Josie, apparently one of our business people, and has been advised that the December 27 closing is critical, due to market conditions.  Theresa also believes that the December 27 date will be aggressive even for F&J, given the late date.  Theresa, please let me know if I have mischaracterized what you said.	I see two options:	1.  If you agree with me that we can t sign the letter as is:  I do my best to get an acceptable letter negotiated with Uriel Dutton today.  If I can t, Mariner retains someone else today.   Frankly, I am not optimistic about getting an acceptable letter from F&J, based on where F&J started.	2.  If you believe that we need to go ahead and get the best deal we can from F&J under the circumstances: I will do my best to get that done by noon or so, and if F&J doesn t budge, we may have to sign the letter as is.	Caveat:  I don t know if Dutton is in the office this week, so he and I may not be able to communicate quickly.  Also, if we redraft a letter, we will probably not have time to get comments back from all the other interested Enron attorneys.

I reviewed a voice-mail from Theresa Bushman this morning about the timing on the new Mariner matter that Mariner for which Mariner would like to retain F&J.  She has spoken with Scott Josie, apparently one of our business people, and has been advised that the December 27 closing is critical, due to market conditions.  Theresa also believes that the December 27 date will be aggressive even for F&J, given the late date.  Theresa, please let me know if I have mischaracterized what you said.	I see two options:	1.  If you agree with me that we can t sign the letter as is:  I do my best to get an acceptable letter negotiated with Uriel Dutton today.  If I can t, Mariner retains someone else today.   Frankly, I am not optimistic about getting an acceptable letter from F&J, based on where F&J started.	2.  If you believe that we need to go ahead and get the best deal we can from F&J under the circumstances: I will do my best to get that done by noon or so, and if F&J doesn t budge, we may have to sign the letter as is.	Caveat:  I don t know if Dutton is in the office this week, so he and I may not be able to communicate quickly.  Also, if we redraft a letter, we will probably not have time to get comments back from all the other interested Enron attorneys.  	I would also suggest telling Kelly Zelacovitz, Mariner s GC, this morning what our game plan is, and if it is option one, have her go ahead and contact her back-up choices of law firms, start running conflicts checks, etc., and have them be ready to hit the ground running.

I will be landing in Houston at 4:51 pm.  I would recommend that following steps be done in order to close the transaction today. 1.  Lisa, Please get Rick Buy s signature for the DASH  -- assuming that Reliant is the counterparty. 2.  Eva or Lisa - Please leave a draft version of the DASH with Tammi Schoppe, Louise Kitchen s assistant. (You might want to tentatively set up an appointment on her calendar.) 3. Gerald - Please check with Reliant s legal , Steve Williams (?), as well as Ken Bradlee and have them send back final  email versions of all appropriate documents. 4. When we have received the appropriate email from Reliant - get on Louise s calendar and have Gerald prepare executables. 5. When the DASH and the Board Resolution document have been signed by Louise and all other relevant individuals listed, send the executables to Reliant. 6. Please have Reliant wire the money after signing the contracts and get a confirmation number. 7. Upon receiving a confirmation number related to the wire transfer, please have Julie sign the returned executables from Reliant. Then, have a glass of wine on me!  I will be calling during the day.

234888,2001-11-26 06:10:48,"Louise, On Monday, prior to my leaving for Buffalo,  I spoke with Dave Gorte and was informed that since the sale of the Napoleonville Land was greater than $2.5 MM, it is categorized as a diversiture requiring a DASH.   Since the negotiations were quite contentious between Reliant, Texas Brine and Enron - we (Eva, Lisa and myself) had worked with Mr. Gorte to create multiple versions of the DASH.  It was not until Wednesday afternoon that Reliant was the chosen ""victor.""  In addition, since I felt you were apprised of the deal and Mr. Gorte had not informed me of an appropriate process, Lisa had waited until we knew who the counterparty was before getting on your schedule. Unfortunately, this meant Wednesday afternoon around 4 pm, but we had been informed by Tammi Schoppe that you were available until 5 pm. Even though the banks were closed, I had wanted to sign the executables on Wednesday so Reliant would not have an opportunity to change their mind over the holiday weekend.  It was certainly not our intent to have you not appropriately briefed regarding the transaction. I will be flying back to Houston today and will be landing around 5 pm.  Both Eva Rainer and Lisa Druzbik are in today and I am leaving instructions to (hopefully) close the deal today.  Julie Gomez will be signing on my behalf -- for detailed questions regarding the negotiations please refer to Eva.  My cell is 713-302-4187. Regards, Jean"

As such, for the potential sale of the Napoleonville Land, Julie Gomez will sign on my behalf for LRCI Inc. after both appropriate commercial, accounting and legal parameters have been met. The status is as follows:Texas Brine has been informed that another counterparty has presented a premium bid of $ 3 MM and has the opportunity to counter.  Texas Brine was the first counterparty to try to acquire the land at $2.35 MM.Reliant has slowed the transaction close due to their legal changes to the ""Act of Sale"" document.  As such, Gerald Nemec (my legal) is reviewing the document in conjuction with our Louisiana counsel as well as other relevant internal legal groups (i.e. litigation and environmental).I am confident that the land will get sold and was hoping to close the transaction prior to my leaving.  However, this bidding ""war"" has the potential for ENA to extract an even higher auction price.  The approximate book value of the land is $1.4 MM.I can be reached via Blackberry or cell (713-302-4187).

We have made 2 changes to the netting agreement forms on the basis of further review by Leslie Hansen of some provisions in our trading forms.  The first change is in paragraph 2(a) to clarify the definition of Default.  The second change is in paragraph 14(b) to delete the day limitation on claims of Force Majeure.  We feel this should not be included in any physical contract that will be included in a master netting agreement, especially because of the current international situation and security concerns.See attached reline version to read the changes. 3.

235170,2001-12-19 07:55:49,"Stephanie, Transwestern has been in discussions with ENA since very early December regarding the sale of the Enron Compression Services gas. The ECS off take is supposed to be 11,000 per day. The fact that ECS was not able to nominate their gas has been problematic for Transwestern in that it causes our line pack to be higher than it otherwise would be. When we began discussions, we were open to the idea of getting the full volume out of our system by the end of the month. If a nomination could have been made that resulted in a sale starting at the beginning of this week, ECS could have sold the entire 363,000 in December. At some point, it becomes unrealistic to expect to be able to do that. It has taken ECS so long to arrange for an agent that a now we are looking at selling the entire volume in just 12 days (~30,000/day). I was expecting the following two things from ENA, 1) confirmation from you that ECS was set up to sell their gas, and 2) a start date for a sale with some advanced notice. I would then have conferred with operations to see if it would be possible to move the entire 363,000 in December. I did not expect ENA to arrange the sale before circling back with TW. If I had known that you were about to close a sale, I could have arranged to be pulled out of my meetings Tuesday afternoon. I have advised Patti Sullivan that TW is able to deliver 25,000/d through the end of the month. The balance can be delivered in January. I am confident that things will run smoother in the future. Regards, Paul "

235172,2001-12-18 18:24:10,"Greetings Paul: Eric Boyt advised that TWPL was not in a position to deliver the full volume of approx. 363,000 mmbtu for the remainder of the month for the account of Enron Compression Services.  This would have been good information to know BEFORE we sold the gas.  I left a couple of messages today but never heard from you.  Unfortunately, we have sold this volume, at your repeated request, and are not in a position to retrade the deal.  To the extent TWPL is unable to perform, please call Janie Tholt or Randy Gay to see if they can reduce the commited volume. I am scheduled to be out tomorrow but may have to come in for the afternoon. Please advise ASAP. Ragards, Stephaniex31688"

252508,2002-01-24 14:00:42,"X-FileName: john zufferli 6-26-02.PSTWe have traditionally have had currency issues in Canada regarding P&L preservation versus cashflow preservation.We have been valued in P&L under the US$ but due to Revenue Canada reasons our functional currency has been C$ (i.e.  the preponderence of cashflows were in C$ from the legacy gas deals, PetroCanada, Suncour, etc, and the PPA position).  Since trader evaluation at year end has been in US$, traders would hedge C$ positions immediately as the trade occured.  The hedge would extend until the position rolled of his book.  From a P&L systems point of view, this would preserve the trader s P&L in US$.  However, from a treasury point of view currency risk would still exist until cash exchange hands; these cash exchange dates were different for financial trades, physical trades and inter-company trades.  There was also some currency risk (albeit small) between billing dates from SAP and settlement dates of the respective trade type.It is my opinion that the functional currency should match the evaluation currency in order to mitigate many of the above problems.  To a certain extent, I am indifferent if it is US$ or C$.The timeline of the decision is being driven by our accounting group who need to set up the SAP system.  They are trying to work within a deadline to have the company capable of performing transactions by Jan 29.  This is the date that they have been told to meet by Houston.  As a result, we would need a determinination of the functional currency by Mon Jan 28."

The bankruptcy isue is around whether the supply of parts will be available going foward. They are probably being discounted which makes it a good buy.

Here is what I know as of 2:00 today.  This is an evolving process.  Please distribute this note as appropriate:All movement of  data  from Enron to UBS is subject to legal approval.  Legal is developing policy guidelines that will govern what and how much data individual users and the IT department can move.Data can be defined as application data (source code, executables, scripts, etc...), business data (curves, prices, deals, weather forecasts, etc...), and office documents (spreadsheets, word files, etc...)Data is housed in many different places, including desktop C drives, individual network H drives, common file servers (O/M/R/W drives), database servers, application servers, and web servers. Several steps have already been completed:The physical file server environments for UBS have been established.The physical DB server environments for UBS have been established.The physical application and web server environments for UBS have been established.Some file server directories have already been copied.  This was limited to data (executables, risk excel sheets, etc...) necessary for IT to test our critical applications in the new UBS production environment.Our large EnPower and TDS Oracle databases were also copied for application testing.Where do we stand?I am maintaining, and have distributed to this group, an inventory of all software and hardware components associated with our Power application portfolio.  The inventory includes specific common file server directories that are necessary for our Power apps to run.  We have received input from several business owners in this area.Legal and IT are collaborating on a process for moving file server data. (H/O/M/R/W)  We are expecting a process definition within days, given our Day 0 target of February 6th.  (legal integration date)At this time, it sounds like individual UBS employees will participate in identifying files on the various file server drives listed above and signing a document specifying that that data movement adheres to legal policy guidelines.  Individuals may even be asked to physically move (drag and drop) files from the old Enron drives to UBS holding drives.  This is still under discussion.We have made some basic assumptions about the amount of business data to be moved to UBS.  I have provided Tim, Kevin, and Lloyd an overview of these assumptions.  This is also still under discussion.I will schedule a meeting in the next couple of days to discuss this, and other transition issues, in more detail.Thanks, Steve"

257462,2001-11-26 09:16:21,"This is an alert that FERC will be more critical in the future of negotiated rate deals.  The orders discussed below dealt with buyout provisions in negotiated rate deals that Tennessee, ANR and Columbia had done.  These provisions had previously been permitted as negotiated rates, but FERC has decided that there is ""significant potential for undue discrimination"" and the recourse rates do not provide an adequate alternative.   Thus, anything in a negotiated rate deal that is not strictly rate-related will most likely be subject to intense scrutiny.FERC ADDS ANOTHER LAYER TO POLICY ON NEGOTIATED-RATE AUTHORITYActing on a series of contract-specific cases, FERC last week sharpened its policy on what is, and isnot, allowed under negotiated rates. In further defining its policy, the commission continued to leanheavily on the ""linchpin"" of negotiated-rate authority - that a customer not willing or able to negotiate adeal must always have the option of obtaining needed capacity under cost-based recourse rates.During discussion of the orders, Chairman Pat Wood III said it was ""important to keep in mind, as werush into the brave new world on the gas side,"" that ""all customers must be treated on a nondiscriminatorybasis by pipelines."" Last week s proclamation should be considered ""a reaffirmation of that nondiscriminatorytrend,"" he asserted.In representative language, the commission said it wants to ensure that parties ""are clear about contractingpractices that we find unacceptable because they present a significant potential for undue discrimination and thosethat we find acceptable because they can be permitted without substantial risk"" of such unequal treatment.FERC declared that a ""key factor"" in determining whether a negotiated provision is considered an""appropriate material deviation"" from a pipeline s filed tariff schedule is the extent to which recourse ratesprovide ""adequate alternatives"" to other shippers.In cases involving rates negotiated by ANR Pipeline Co. (GT01-25, RP99-301), Tennessee Gas PipelineCo. (RP96-312, et al.) and Columbia Gas Transmission Corp. (CP01-70), the commission ruled that thebuyout provisions are not allowed unless they are offered to all shippers as part of the pipelines  generallyavailable tariffs.The provisions at issue allow customers to buy out or terminate their contract demand levels prior tothe end of the deals. While the commission previously has held that such provisions can be included in anegotiated-rate package, ""we have reconsidered that holding"" because similar buyout opportunities arenot available to more traditional shippers operating under recourse rates, it said in the Tennessee order.Where a customer is seeking service for a set contract term and quantity, recourse service provides an""adequate alternative,"" the commission observed. ""However, if the customer desires a special contractdemand reduction or early termination right not provided in the generally applicable tariff, the availabilityof service at the recourse rate does not provide an adequate substitute, since recourse service would notinclude any such provision."" A shipper obtaining such a provision would be insulated from a certaindegree of risk, giving it ""an advantage over recourse-rate shippers,"" the commission pointed out.""A shipper s right to reduce, or terminate, its contract demand before the expiration of its contract is avaluable right, since it can enable the shipper to avoid significant liability for future reservation charges,""FERC said, adding that ""such a valuable right must be granted in a not unduly discriminatory manner.""Requiring pipelines to file generally applicable tariff provisions setting forth the conditions underwhich they will offer contract demand reduction rights ""is the best means of assuring that those rights willbe negotiated"" in a fair manner, FERC reasoned. Once approved, the tariff language ""will require thepipeline to grant similar rights to similarly situated customers.""Commissioner Linda Breathitt applauded the policy shift, characterizing it as a much-needed shot inthe arm for a program that had become ""muddled."" Through a ""tortured line of cases,"" FERC s definitionsof allowable contracting practices were ""obscured,"" Breathitt said in welcoming the new ""common-sense""approach. The ""tug of war"" that parties have engaged in over the past few years ""really hasn t served ourobjective of ensuring that nondiscriminatory rates and service"" are available to all shippers, she said."

With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company s current circumstances.After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.Ken Lay"

257651,2001-11-08 08:02:49,While trading on EOL or moving physical power you should not have a position larger than 100 MW.  If you find yourself at these positions while trading EOL you should then widen your market so that you do not take on a larger position.  If you have any questions please let me know.  I would recommend that you put EOL product properties on manage stack... then you will be able to widen your market easily when your position reaches the 100 MW limit.Paul

We had proposed to them what Kevin had suggested, and they said their view on pricing in Virginia is slightly different (at a discount to PJM/VAP as against a premium suggested by us).  They d requested we send them some discussion points from our meeting today, so we can continue our discussions on an ongoing basis. Please review the bullet-point summary of our discussions last week, and the draft proposal.  We would appreciate your quick comments - but keep in mind, this is just to stimulate further discussions with them. Our overall objective is to migrate them to a new contract and away from their rights to audit the last few years.Discussion summary:?	Both parties agree that the contract needs to be revised to reflect current market conditions (pricing, liquidated damages, etc.).?	Enron would retain flexibility around the physical delivery points.?	VEPCO would like to continue treating this as a call option (versus a firm delivery).?	Settlement:  Would prefer the Day-Ahead index versus the hourly index?	Could also look at another PJM West index - VAP/Alleghany?	Will look at alternate times for calling on power, if necessary?	Would like to renegotiate by 12/01/01 Rahil"

I d like to begin by apologi=zing for the lack of broad e-mail communications or floor meetings over the= last couple of weeks.  These have been very hard times and I know that peo=ple have wanted information.  It has taken us nearly a week to sort through= who will be part of the UBS Warburg team and who continue with Enron. =20In this e-mail I will explain: (1) who will be going to UBS Warburg, (2) wh=o do the people working for Enron work for and what are they expected to do=, (3) how will the physical separation between Enron and UBS Warburg happen=, and (4) when will the sale of Netco to UBS Warburg be completed.

It is no=t entirely clear to me right now what the management team for west power lo=oks like for the Enron estate now.  As I understand it, there are two prima=ry initiatives on the estate side that people in Portland may be a part of.=  The first is the disposition of our development projects that are already= well under way.  Dave Parquet in San Francisco has been leading this effor=t together with the Portland asset development team.  This effort has been =ongoing since December.  The second is the disposition of our west power co=mmodity positions.  Jim Fallon is in charge of this for the entire company.=  People working on this for Jim include Don Miller, Paul Racicot, Brad Ric=hter, Ed Baughman among others.  I have placed a call to Jim and to Paul to= get advice on how people in Portland should proceed.  I would recommend ta=lking to Ed, Brad, Paul, or Don to get direction.  I have placed a call to =several of these people to get direction and am waiting for a response.  I =am hopeful that they will designate a lead person in Portland to coordinate= the power procurement and delivery efforts.As most of you know, the physical separation between UBS Warburg and Enron =has already begun.  People who will continue to work for Enron will be loca=ted on the 4th Floor, while UBS Warburg will occoupy the 3rd Floor.  We hop=e to make the moves to the 4th Floor by the end of this week.  Moves within= the 3rd Floor will take place the following week.The UBS Warburg transaction is subject to one last pro forma regulatory hur=dle.  While I don t have an exact date, I am told that it will likely be on= or about February 6th.Finally, I want to once again thank everyone for their help and cooperation= over the last few weeks.  These have been really horrible times as the Enr=on story continues to unfold in the news at the same time that people are f=inding out about their future with Enron and UBS.  I know that this hasn t =been easy for anyone.  I am deeply saddened overseeing the breakup of the a=wesome team that we have put together.

Basically the research group think the option should be valued as a basis option for the whole period from the evaluation day to the expiration day, instead of for just one day ---- this is what we are doing in portcalc right now, except that the current evaluation is based on Craig vs. Rockie instead of Craig vs. PV.  The argument for that is that although the strike price won t be known till the last day, the whole price change process between today and then determines the final price.   I think Alex s example is quite eloquent:  say the basis difference between Craig and PV is zero today for 6/1/2002, it is very unlikely that the basis difference will still be zero on 5/31/2002.  If we evaluated as a one-day basis option whose basis price difference is one, the option value will be almost zero, and the option is underestimated.  Put everything together, this is the suggested evaluation Research came up with:  Underlying: forward hourly price for the expiration date in delivery region  Strike: forward price for the delivery day in index region  Time to expiration: time between evaluation date and expiration date.  Alex and Zimin, please feel free to correct me if you find any error above.  Thanks,- Zhiyun"

269312,2001-11-09 16:00:53,"X-FileName: holden salisbury 6-26-02.PSTHere is the Q&A on the agreement and the press release. Merger Q&ANov. 9, 2001 THE DEALWhat are the deal terms?The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange. The exchange ratio will be 0.2685. As an example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 269 shares of the combined company upon closing. Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares. ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy s outstanding common stock. ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately, and an additional $1 billion upon closing of the merger. Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron s Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock. Enron will have immediate access to the $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron s Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.What approvals are required?This merger will require SEC and FERC approvals, the approval of shareholders of both Enron and Dynegy, and expiration or termination of the Hart-Scott-Rodino waiting period. In addition, various approvals are required due to the ownership of Enron s and Dynegy s wholly owned subsidiaries.From a business standpoint, are Enron and Dynegy now one company?Not until closing, which may not occur for a number of months. Until that time we will continue to deal with one another on a commercial level as competitors, just as we have done in the past. In general, this means that we cannot share commercial information, coordinate commercial behavior, agree on prices, etc. We will act towards Dynegy the same way that we would act toward any other competitor.When do you expect the deal to close?The transaction is expected to close by the end of Q3 2002.Why do you believe this is the best deal for shareholders?The Board considered numerous options-stand-alone execution, private equity infusions, strategic partner infusion and a merger with a strategic partner. The Enron Board felt that the merger with Dynegy, coupled with the $1.5 billion equity investment, was the best opportunity for continued growth and shareholder value.What is the ownership structure of the new company? On a converted basis, Enron shareholders will own approximately 36% of the new company, and Dynegy shareholders will own 64%. Post closing, the combined company is expected to have approximately 700 million shares outstanding.What percentage of shareholder votes is required to approve the transaction? A majority of Enron shareholders must approve the transaction, and 2/3 of Dynegy shareholders must approve.Has a new management team been identified?Chuck Watson - Chairman and CEOSteve Bergstrom - President and COOGreg Whalley - Executive Vice PresidentRobert Doty - CFOWatson, Bergstrom and Whalley will make up the combined company s Office of the Chairman.Has Dynegy completed due diligence? Are they satisfied that the potential exposure is manageable?Dynegy has completed significant due diligence and there is no due diligence out as such. Dynegy was fully aware of the matters reported recently with respect to certain financial statement restatements and related party transactions.How will the Board seats be allocated?When the merger is complete, the Board of Directors of the combined company will be comprised of no more than 15 members. Dynegy s designees will include three from ChevronTexaco. Enron will have the right to designate a minimum of three board members.How will the merger impact customers?We expect customers to benefit significantly from this combination. This combination provides a wider and more diverse platform to meet the energy needs of our customers with reliable delivery and predictable pricing. Customers will also benefit from broader supply-sources of the two companies.Does this mean Northern Natural Gas is no longer a part of Enron?No. Northern Natural Gas will remain an important member of the Enron family. If the merger is terminated Dynegy has a right to acquire Northern Natural Gas, subject to a repurchase right of Enron.Is Dynegy buying Northern Natural Gas?No, Dynegy is buying a $1.5 billion preferred stock interest in Northern Natural Gas and acquiring an option to acquire 100% of Northern Natural Gas in certain circumstances if the merger is terminated.What percent of Northern Natural Gas will Dynegy own?They will own preferred stock unless and until the merger is terminated and Dynegy exercises its right under certain circumstances to purchase 100% of Northern Natural Gas.FINANCIAL ISSUESWhy is Enron merging at this price?Enron s Board of Directors and management considered numerous options to best serve the interest of our shareholders, including: Stand-alone execution. Private equity infusion. Strategic partner infusion. A merger with a strategic partner.The Board and management feel strongly that a merger with Dynegy, which included an immediate infusion of $1.5 billion in cash, offered the best opportunity for continued growth and enhanced shareholder value. Have you discussed the combination with the rating agencies?Yes. The preliminary assessment by the rating agencies has been positive.ENRON QUESTIONSWhat are the immediate business benefits of the transaction?This deal confirms the value of Enron s core business and strengthens the company s liquidity. This transaction enables the shareholders of both companies to participate in the upside of the combined enterprise.What will happen to Enron Online?It will continue as EnronOnline until the transaction closes.How will you treat proprietary trading information prior to the deal close? What impact will this have on counterparty trading?Until the deal closes they remain separate companies and will keep confidential trading information confidential.What will happen to Enron s pending asset sales?The asset sales we have previously announced are scheduled to move forward.What happens to the SEC investigation?As we have from the beginning, Enron will continue to fully cooperate with the SEC investigation.What happens to the lines of credit Enron took out last week?Enron drew down on $3 billion from existing credit lines and has obtained commitment letters on an additional $1 billion secured financing.Will any Enron executives have a role in the combined company s senior management team?Yes, Greg Whalley will serve as Executive Vice President and will join Dynegy s Office of the Chairman when the transaction closes.What happens to Ken Lay?Ken Lay will remain as Chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes. He will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.Will Enron complete its new building?Yes.Is Enron s vision still to be the world s leading company?Enron s vision will be revisited once the companies are merged.Will this affect Enron s innovation?A key strength of Enron and Dynegy has been their employees  innovation and we expect this to continue.What will this do to our deregulation efforts?Both Enron and Dynegy share the belief in open markets and competition.

Who will be on it?The integration process will be focused on designing a strong and efficient organization. Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient transition. Details of the make-up of the team have not yet been determined.Will the companies merge offices and where?There are currently no plans to merge offices. Considering the size of a combined organization, however, office spaces will be evaluated at a later date.COMMUNITY ISSUESWill Enron Field be renamed?The combined company will determine this.Is Enron s contribution program continuing during this time?The contributions program will still be a focus for Enron, but we have curtailed new giving for now.What does this merger mean for Houston?We believe that it is positive for Houston because two premier energy companies will join forces and remain in the city.EMPLOYMENT ISSUESWill Enron (or Dynegy) employees be laid off as a result of the merger?The merger will be a long and complex process. Some elimination of positions is almost inevitable in this type of merger, and one of the key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure and resourcing of the merged company.How many lay offs will there be?Prior to the merger, we hope to address any need for employment reductions through attrition and reduced hirings. We cannot rule out involuntary separations, but we have not targeted a specific number at this time.If I am laid off, either prior to the merger completion (or as a result of it), what will my severance package be? Will the severance plan change?If an Enron employee is let go prior to the merger, and is eligible for benefits under the Enron Corp. Severance Plan, then the terms of that plan will govern. Post merger, employees will be eligible for benefits under whatever severance plan the merged company adopts. No changes to the severance plan have been made at this time.What happens to our bonuses this year?The 2001 bonus process will continue as usual and will be consistent with previous practice based on company and individual performance.What will happen to my stock options?Your vested unexercised and unvested options will be converted as follows:The number of options will be converted on the same ratio as outstanding shares are converted. Your number of Enron options will be multiplied by 0.2685 to calculate the number of Dynegy options at close. At the closing of the merger, the strike price on your Enron options will be divided by the merger ratio 0.2685 to determine the strike price of the new Dynegy options.Will there be salary adjustments as a result of the merger?Both companies will continue our market-based approach to compensating employees. In addition, both companies have a strong pay for performance philosophy in regard to total cash compensation. Prior to the merger, there will be no changes in Enron s salary structure. Post merger, we will jointly determine our salary strategy and structure.What will happen with benefits and retirement programs?There are no anticipated changes to Enron benefit plans before the merger is completed. Upon completion of the merger we anticipate that there will likely be changes to ensure that one benefits strategy exists for the merged company.Will the analyst and associate program at Enron continue?As we bring both companies together, we will look into the possibility of combining both Dynegy s PACE program with Enron s Associate/Analyst program.Where do I go if I have a question?A detailed general Q & A on the merger is being prepared at present and will be posted on the Enron Update intranet page. Additionally, Enron and Dynegy HR teams are jointly preparing a detailed employee Q & A to address HR-related questions. This will be posted on the same website as the general Q & A. In the interim, if you have a specific question or concern you may email questions@enron.com. INTERNAL ISSUESWhat will happen to non-Houston locations?Decisions will be made about all locations in the coming weeks.Will moves to the new building continue as planned?Yes, at this time.When will we begin seeing changes in our workplace?Until the merger is completed it is unlikely you will see many changes in the workplace. As things change, we will share this information with you.Will there be a year-end PRC?We are still reviewing the year-end process.Does Dynegy have a performance review process like Enron?Dynegy has a similar performance review to Enron s.Will there still be a Chairman s Award?Yes.Will any early retirement packages be offered?There are no plans to offer such packages at this time.Is there a hiring freeze? Will all open positions at Enron just remain open or be cancelled?We are carefully evaluating every open position and only staffing those that are critical to the business.INTERNAL - COMMUNITY RELATIONSWill the VIP program continue?We are currently evaluating this program.Will the matching gifts program continue?We are currently evaluating this program.What happens to the Enron childcare center?It will continue its current operations. We will re-evaluate operations after the merger.What happens to ClickatHome?We are currently evaluating this program.If employees are laid off, will they be required to pay for their computers from the ClickatHome program?Enron s current policy will remain in effect which states that individuals who leave as a consequence of involuntary termination are not required to pay back the cost of the computer, however, they are required to pay the taxes as stated on heir W2 form.Will the Enron Body Shop remain open?The Body Shop will remain open and continue with normal hours. Once the merger is nearing completion the program will be evaluated.What does this mean for the United Way?Both Enron and Dynegy are supporters of the United Way. The merged entity will also continue to support the UW. The company will match all employee contributions to the United Way as promised."

Credit limits, etc. will be tested during the simulation.Information Technology:Will assist in preparing data on the system for the simulation.After the simulation is over, will work with the relevant groups to test the trade-data in various systems and risk booksWill ensure all simulation data is removed from the system after the simulation is complete.Next steps Traders and Originators will be contacted prior to simulation day to ensure they have appropriate access to the system.Originators will be assigned specific roles. You should expect to receive an email and/or handout on or before Wednesday, Feb. 6.UBSWenergy personnel will be meeting with back office personnel over the next several days to ensure everything is in place for the simulation.SummaryThis simulation is an important step towards re-launching our trading business.

Happy New Year to you too and I hope it is a better year for all of= us.  Today they announced that UBS Warburg has purchased the trading compa=ny.  This is good news except we do not know any information about how the =company will be structured so I still do not know if I will have a job.  Th=is is stressful because it has been going on for so long.  I wish something= would happen good or bad.  Originally I thought this would be a terrible t=hing to not have a job at Enron or in the energy sector but as time goes on= I have come to think maybe it would just force us to do something else wit=h our lives.  Something we have thought about for a long time. It is a trag=edy that after 25 years of service we will get no severance.  I feel so sad= for all those people who lost everything including a job.  Dick has been r=etained as a key employee for EES to help close down the business so his jo=b will eventually end.  We have no time frame for him.  Hope everything is =going well for you and your family.  Take care!

During this week, we will be working hard to get as many of the PA s returned as possible. Once we have a signed PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch the new site.A Splash page will be available at www.UBSWenergy.com or via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com. This page will tell customers about the pending launch of www.UBSWenergy.com and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Sub Users.The Splash page will look something like the following: Week of Feb. 4:We will send out a mass mailing to approx. 3,000 individuals at 450 companies inviting them to sign up for the site. Included in the package will be a simple brochure, copies of the PA and ETA, key messages and a list of Frequently Asked Questions.Week of Feb. 11:The site will launch, with at least financial products (timing for gas physical and power physical to be determined according to regulatory issues). General Terms and Conditions (GTC s) will be available online and must be accepted online before a company can start to trade a particular commodity.		Trading/Origination CoordinationThe Top 50 customers will have at least an initial contact within the first two days of starting the marketing effort and that all customers who previously traded either gas or power will receive a mailing within the first 10 days.

Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.The main areas to focus on over the next week are:- (i)     Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)                               To be forwarded to Louise               These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.          The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.     (ii)    Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)                                                To be forwarded to Faith Killen         First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized) (iii)   Seating Plans                                                           Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate         We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.        I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.(iv)    Due Diligence         We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out. Happy New Year Louise"

274308,2001-11-08 15:13:45,"X-FileName: phillip platter 6-26-02.PST Dynegy-Enron Deal Faces Significant Reg ReviewBy Bryan Lee  11/08/2001 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES    WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- Any merger deal that may emerge between Dynegy Inc. (DYN) and Enron Corp. (ENE) will face a complicated and time-consuming regulatory-review process, legal experts said Thursday.Any equity deal would require approvals from numerous U.S. federal regulatory agencies and state utility regulators, as well as survive Canadian and European antitrust reviews, energy attorneys contacted by Dow Jones Newswires said. A merger would require approvals from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Securities and Exchange Commission, Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission. And the Illinois Commerce Commission likely would weigh into the mix, since Dynegy owns Illinova s Illinois Power Co. Any effort to strike a deal quickly also could be complicated by Enron s ownership of Portland General Electric Co. While Enron has entered into an agreement to sell the utility to Northwest Natural Gas Co. (NWN), a previous attempt to sell the company fell through because of regulatory complications. A key issue for federal regulators scrutinizing a potential Enron-Dynegy merger will be the degree of electricity market concentration such a transaction would entail, the attorneys said. Financially wounded Enron is the nation s largest electricity and natural gas trader with an extensive network of gas pipelines. Dynegy is ranked sixth nationally in both electricity and natural gas marketing. The transaction would receive the greatest scrutiny at FERC, where the merger application would challenge the commission s merger-review policy, attorneys said.         Racing Against The Liquidity Clock    ""Enron is a complicated beast,"" and an acquisition by Dynegy likely would ""stretch FERC s limits of market-power review,"" one legal expert said. The primary question the commission will consider is whether combining the companies will increase market concentration in wholesale power markets to an unacceptable level. Also, FERC is in the process of changing the basis upon which it authorizes electricity sales at market-based rates, which could pose complications for a combined Enron-Dynegy down the road. According to Platts Power Markets Week, Enron s market share in competitive power markets is nearly 15%, while Dynegy s is pushing 5%. That makes the combined market share perilously close to the 20% threshold of concern under antitrust review. But FERC will undertake a more complicated analysis than that, looking at both vertical and horizontal market power, attorneys said. On a horizontal basis, there likely won t be much concern at FERC. Enron owns few hard generating assets compared to Dynegy, although FERC will scrutinize generation assets that Enron doesn t own but controls the output of on a contractual basis. It is in the vertical market power analysis where FERC s merger review gets truly complicated. The commission will assess to what degree the combination of Enron s pipelines - including one that controls 23% of natural gas imported from Canada - and Dynegy s portfolio of electric generation assets present competitive concerns. While Dynegy s pipeline holdings are far smaller than Enron s, it does have some upstream natural gas processing and gathering assets that FERC could view as problematic. Never before has FERC encountered a vertical market power analysis of such scale and scope before, legal experts agreed. Another aspect of the deal that will interest FERC, according to one attorney, is Enron s Internet-based trading platform, EnronOnline, through which 25% of wholesale power sales are traded. FERC has traditionally only looked at hard assets, but in recent weeks has indicated it intends to take a harder look at financial assets when considering market power issues. But even if FERC doesn t take on the issue, the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission certainly will when considering the antitrust aspects of the combination. ""These two companies are huge commodity traders. Oftentimes they re trading in commodities that have nothing to do with energy,"" noted one attorney. Antitrust agencies will scrutinize whether the combination could present market power concerns for nonenergy-related commodities as well as electricity and natural gas. As if the complicated market-power reviews by FERC and antitrust agencies weren t enough, the deal also must pass muster at the Securities and Exchange Commission under the 1935 Public Utility Holding Company Act. The Depression-era law restricts the geographic scope and nonenergy business holdings of multistate utility holding companies. Dynegy is an exempt holding company under the act, since its utility holding is confined to one state. It would have to register under the law and potentially divest assets to garner SEC approval as long as Enron still holds Portland General Electric, attorneys agreed. The SEC review also is complicated by the 26% stake in Dynegy held by ChevronTexaco (CVX). That investment was structured in a highly complex manner to avoid triggering regulation under the 1935 holding company act, according to a lawyer familiar with the deal. Dynegy could structure the deal in several different ways in order to sidestep holding company act restrictions, according to a leading legal expert on the law. Dynegy could take nonvoting or preferred stock with conversion rights contingent on Enron s selling the Oregon utility, the attorney said. ""There are ways to structure it short of a stock-for-stock deal, which is what most people think about."" Given the race against the clock driven by Enron s increasingly perilous liquidity crunch, such an investment sidestepping regulatory review may be the way the companies have to go in the near term. ""It s a run on the bank,"" the holding company act expert said. A Wall Street analyst suggested that, given Enron s predominance in energy markets, concerned Washington regulators and politicians may choose to expedite the deal. ""Enron going down on the verge of winter is not a good thing,"" the analyst said. ""They may be more lenient if they can put a frigging tourniquet on Enron.""    -By Bryan Lee, Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-6647; Bryan.Lee@dowjones.com   Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Enron Receives Dynegy $1.5B Cash Infusion Tues. >DYN ENEBy Christina Cheddar  11/14/2001 Dow Jones News Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Dynegy Inc. (DYN) provided Enron Corp. (ENE) Tuesday with the $1.5 billion cash infusion envisioned in the companies  merger agreement, a Dynegy spokeswoman said. Dynegy received preferred stock and other rights in an Enron unit that owns the Northern Natural Gas pipeline in return for its investment.The cash infusion, which was made with the assistance of Dynegy s largest shareholder, ChevronTexaco Corp. (CVX), is aimed at providing Enron with additional cash liquidity to support its core energy marketing and trading operations. The rights provide Dynegy with the option to acquire the pipeline unit should the two companies fail to complete their merger. The deal, which still needs shareholder and regulatory approval, is expected to close within the next six to nine months. Dynegy is acquiring Enron for 0.2685 of a Dynegy share, or about $10 billion based on the recent price of Dynegy shares. The acquisition of Enron by its smaller rival follows a series of disclosures about Enron s financial dealings with partnerships run by some of its corporate officers. The dealings are under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission and at the center of more than a dozen of shareholder lawsuits. During the last month, Enron watched as its share price sunk to a small fraction of its earlier levels as shareholder confidence in the trading company evaporated. As credit-rating agencies began to cut Enron s debt ratings threatening the company s investment-grade status, the company scrambled to raise additional cash to shore up its balance sheet and protect confidence in its business. Industry experts viewed Dynegy s cash infusion as one way the companies sought to bolster confidence in the energy trader s liquidity, and protect its most valuable business. In a conference call earlier Wednesday, Enron said its core energy trading business has been temporarily hurt by the uncertainty created by recent events. According to Dynegy spokeswoman Jennifer Rosser, the preferred stock Dynegy has received for its investment in Enron is convertible into the common stock of the Enron pipeline unit. Dynegy also has the right to convert the preferred stock into Enron shares if it desires, the spokeswoman said. For example, if Enron were to cancel its merger with Dynegy in order to accept a higher bid from another suitor, Dynegy might decide to convert its preferred shares into Enron stock in order to reap the profits created by an increase in Enron s stock price, Rosser said. In either case, Dynegy wouldn t be required to pay any additional consideration. Dynegy was able to make the cash infusion after ChevronTexaco, of San Francisco, made an investment in Dynegy. If the acquisition closes as anticipated, ChevronTexaco, which owns about one-fourth of Dynegy, plans to make an additional $1 billion investment in the combined company. ChevronTexaco also has the right to purchase an additional $1.5 billion in Dynegy stock in the first three years following the close of the acquisition. Enron officials said they are monitoring the energy market s reaction to the cash infusion, and hopes it will restore the confidence of its counterparties. Enron remains on a credit watch at the credit-rating agencies. Moody s Investors Service and Standard & Poor s each have Enron rated one notch above speculative grade. -By Christina Cheddar, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5166; christina.cheddar@dowjones.com   Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

274423,2001-12-20 10:19:03,"X-FileName: phillip platter 6-26-02.PSTTo the West Desk et al:The FERC s west-wide price cap has been raised to at least $108/MWh beginning today through 30 April 02.  Please see the order excerpt below.  Although market prices are well below both the old and new cap, the new cap will give the markets more breathing room if there is an unexpected cold snap and/or supply disruption.I am happy to report that the one of Enron s advocacy messages made it into the order: any change to the cap must be applied West-wide.  PNW parties and Duke were willing to settle with region-specific caps but FERC rejected that concept in favor of a single, West-wide value.Alan ComnesRelevant Passage:""Effective on the trading day following the date of this order, through April 30, 2002, we will suspend the methodology used to calculate the current mitigated price and substitute the following West-wide winter season methodology. As a starting point, themitigated price will be set at $108/MWh. This is the actual mitigated price set using the current methodology during the last reserve deficiency on May 31, 2001, based on a gas index of $6.641/MMBtu, a generating unit with a heat rate of approximately 15,360 Btu/MWh and $6.00 for the O&M adder. The new interim mitigated price will supersede the existing mitigated price (approximately $92/MWh), which was set at eighty-five percent of the originally calculated $108/MWh mitigated price for application during non-reserve deficiency hours. We find this adjustment necessary to set the price for the winter period and to track changes in the gas indices.The winter formula will maintain the current heat rate and O&M adder. The one variable in the formula will be tied to the current average of the mid-point for the monthly bid-week index prices reported for SoCal Gas (large packages), Malin and PG&E city-gate. Under the winter season formula, the mitigated price will be recalculated when the average gas price rises by a minimum factor of 10 percent (e.g., to $7.305/MMBtu) effective for the following trading day. The formula will also track subsequentcumulative changes of at least 10 percent (including reductions of 10 percent, but not less than a floor of $108/Mwh). Effective on May 1, 2002, the summer methodology will be reinstated along with the current mitigated price of approximately $92/Mwh for non-emergency periods."""

274533,2002-01-24 11:58:35,"X-FileName: phillip platter 6-26-02.PSTJanuary 23, 2002 Dow Jones NewswiresCalif Attorney Genl Says Likely To File More Energy SuitsDow Jones NewswiresSAN FRANCISCO (AP)--California Attorney General Bill Lockyer said Wednesdayhe is likely to file more unfair business practice lawsuits against energysuppliers he thinks overcharged for electricity.But Lockyer, in a telephone interview, said after a yearlong investigationhe has found no criminal wrongdoing by any energy suppliers. He said he hasdiscovered possible civil violations of California consumer laws prohibitingovercharging - violations that carry no jail or prison time.Lockyer s disclosure came a week after the state s top law enforcementofficial sued Pacific Gas and Electric Corp., the parent to Pacific Gas andElectric Co., for allegedly siphoning billions from its underling andforcing it to seek federal bankruptcy protection.The PG&E suit is ""the first of many I would expect in the energy area toovercome overcharges,"" Lockyer told The Associated Press.""We ve devoted a huge amount of investigative and lawyering time to get backthe money...generators extracted from Californians,"" he added.Lockyer declined to name other companies that he would sue, but his officehas subpoenaed records from Dynegy, Enron Corp., Mirant Corp. and ReliantEnergy - all of which have denied wrongdoing. In the interview, the attorneygeneral did mention Enron by name, saying ""we re still looking at the energyovercharges,"" and he accused Enron of withholding documents.Enron, a major energy trading concern, has filed for bankruptcy protectionfollowing the disclosure that it misstated its earnings by hundreds ofmillions of dollars.PG&E, the only supplier Lockyer has sued, blamed its woes on a 1996California law that left it unable to collect the full price of electricityfrom its customers.Lockyer s disclosure that he hasn t discovered criminal conduct, includingno evidence of a conspiracy to fix prices, comes nearly a year after he saidhe wanted to jail Kenneth Lay, Enron s chairman. Lockyer told the WallStreet Journal in May that, ""I would love to personally escort Lay to an 8by 10 cell that he could share with a tattooed dude who says,  Hi my name isSpike, honey."" On Wednesday, Lockyer declared the statement ""rhetorical excess,"" adding,""So far...we haven t found criminal behavior associated with pricingpolicies.""Still, the city of San Francisco has accused 13 energy suppliers ofmanipulating prices in a suit that is pending in San Diego County SuperiorCourt.That suit alleges the suppliers manipulated supplies to keep prices high.San Francisco Deputy City Attorney Mark Slavin said the city doesn t haveproof of those allegations, but would uncover them as the lawsuit proceedsin a process known as discovery.""We think that the discovery process will uncover anticompetitive behavior,""Slavin said.The energy suppliers have denied the allegations.A California legislative committee also investigating a spike in wholesaleenergy costs has served additional subpoenas on Enron officials.The Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation in theWholesale Energy Market summoned Enron officials to appear for depositionsregarding destruction of documents. Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, and thecommittee s chairman, said he s concerned that documents destroyed byEnron s auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, were covered by a legislative subpoenaissued in June.Dunn s committee on Wednesday also agreed to subpoena Andersen regarding theEnron records.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------URL for this Article:http://interactive.wsj.com/archive/retrieve.cgi?id=DI-CO-20020123-011366.djm--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Copyright ? 2002 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

In addition, Risk, Credit, IT, Government Affairs, and the 3rd Floor Legal team should plan to attend Tim s meeting.If you are unsure which meeting to attend please ask.We realize that many people are out today due to the Veteran s Day holiday (no cash trading or scheduling today).  We will have another meeting tomorrow morning for people who were unable to make it to meetings this morning.  We will announce the time and place of that meeting soon.We recognize that the last couple of weeks have been unsettling for many people.  Our goal over the next couple of days is to get back to business as usual.  There are no mandatory layoffs planned for this office.  Chris and I met with John Lavorato, Louise Kitchen, and Greg Whalley over the weekend.  Their marching orders were clear -- go back to Portland and get back to work!  As we mentioned in the all-employee meeting a few weeks ago, this office has a reasonable cost structure and is very profitable."

We can grab a conference after we get back (or tommorow) and talk if you d like.Unfortunately, we have been put on a hiring freeze b/c of everything that is going on.  We brought on three new people on Monday, but they were interviewed and hired about 1 month ago.  We ve lost three people since the merger announcement, but we cant fill their spots w/ new people.Your resume looks good.  You re correct, these jobs are demanding on your personal time.  This is especially true when you first start.  This is something you would have to talk over w/ the manager that you interviewed with to see how demanding the book is that they wanted to put you on.  We can talk more later.Thanks,Errol "

Given that we are coming to the end of the heating season our best opportunities to make money over the next little while will be with respect to storage, storage arbitrage, and opportunities surrounding the injection season.   Having this in mind I think the best place to start is with the pipe that has the most storage capabilities and flexibility, and I think that is Columbia Gas Transmission.  I am inviting everyone to attend a meeting Tuesday at 3:00 (location to follow) to discuss the who, what, where, when, why, and how.   In preparation for the meeting we need to have information regarding the pipe:1)	We need the operational capabilities of the pipe.   This should include major receipt points, delivery points, through put capability, line pack balances, and storage facilities (both owned by the pipeline as well as third parties).  Expect to discuss which regions are the bottle necks, and what operational restrictions or advantages individual locations have. (Rob, Meredith, Bob or Chris could you please try to track down some of this info)2)	We need to talk about trading and transacting in this region.  Proper contracts with the pipe, what flexibility we have (or could get), transportation costs within the region, etc....(Rob, Meredith, Bob or Chris could you please try to track down some of this info)3)	Major players on the pipeline LDC s, Industrials, Power Generators, and production companies (i.e.. native production on the pipe) (Adam and Chuck could you please gather this info)4)	Price Curves and trading opportunities for the region.  (I will be supplying the data for this part of the discussion)Please come ready to talk freely about what you know and please understand that the point of this is to figure out what pieces of information we lack and to make everyone better informed.

VARGAS Copyright 2002 Houston Chronicle Isn t it just like Houston to go for seconds? This title-craving city has been named the fattest, plumpest, most rotund city in America by Men s Fitness for a second consecutive year. Weigh to go. Fattest cities 1. Houston 2. Chicago 3. Detroit 4. Philadelphia 5. Dallas 6. Columbus, Ohio 7. San Antonio 8. Fort Worth 9. St. Louis 10. Indianapolis Fittest cities 1. Colorado Springs, Colo. 2. Denver 3. San Diego 4. Seattle 5. San Francisco 6. Virginia Beach, Va. 7. Honolulu 8. Sacramento, Calif. 9. Albuquerque, N.M. 10. Boston 	""Houstonians need to turn off the TV and get out to their parks where a variety of programs for kids and adults are offered for free,"" the magazine writes. Last year, Houstonians viewed the national magazine as a svelte bully picking on the chubby little kid on the playground and reacted like a protective, angry mother. In 2002, the message is soaking in like a juicy, half-pound hamburger patty on a freshly toasted bun. ""The first year we were kind of upset because we weren t happy or agreed with the ranking because they took into account air quality and other things people can t control,"" says Shadston Pittman, fitness coordinator for the city s Parks and Recreation Department. ""This year the ranking is motivating because we have some projects in place now. I think we can show the world (weight loss) is a priority for us. ""But they still got us. Again."" In fact, Pittman thought Indianapolis would get the top honor. Sorry, they came in 10th. ""I didn t think we d be number one because of the proactive steps we took,"" he says. For the country s 50 largest cities, the magazine took existing data and issued grades in 16 categories such as overweight and obesity rates (D), air quality (F), TV viewing habits (F), water quality (D), parks and open space (D+), nutrition (B-) and climate (C). When the grades were tallied, Houston once again found itself at the head of the class, albeit the one with all the detention-serving kids. The Men s Fitness issue hits newsstands Tuesday. (Meanwhile, we apparently should hit the treadmill.) Not to be outdone, other major Texas cities also found themselves on the heavy side. Dallas ranked fifth. San Antonio was seventh. Fort Worth ranked eighth and El Paso weighed in at 14th. The only Texas city on the light side was Austin, ranked as the 16th fittest. The fittest city was Colorado Springs, Colo. Karen Calabro, coordinator of health promotion and health education at the University of Texas-Houston Health Science Center, says although she doesn t put much stock into the magazine s formula, Houstonians could stand to shed a few pounds. ""We could all lose some weight. Me included,"" the registered dietitian says. Houston, Calabro says, isn t the only city with a caloric-intake and sedentary epidemic. Nationally, 55 percent of adults are overweight or obese, according to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. As your waistline expands so do your chances of developing diseases or conditions such as high blood pressure, heart disease or diabetes, Calabro says. ""A big part of this obesity problem,"" she says, ""is that we re not exercising"" -- not even when the opportunity presents itself for a brisk walk. We opt for the elevator when the stairs call our name. We see escalators as our new best friend. And we drive to the corner store for ice cream. But Pittman hopes to alter our lifestyles and ballooning image. After Houston earned the first unsolicited title, Pittman and two other city officials visited Philadelphia, which owned the ""fattest"" ranking in 2000. Philly started a citywide campaign called ""Fun, Fit and Free"" to get its residents to slim down. Last year, Philadelphia fell out of the top spot and this year is in fourth place. Pittman, who is also a personal trainer and has been fitness coordinator for just a year, says Houston s version will not be under one umbrella slogan like Philadelphia s. However, there will be several endeavors to involve as many people as possible. The city s get-fit effort will kick off Jan. 17 when the city teams up with the Subway sandwich chain to bring the Subway Challenge to Houston. The problem is so serious that Subway is sending its big-gun spokesman to the Jan. 17 event. From 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. outside City Hall, 900 Smith, participants can meet Jared Fogle, who lost 245 pounds on a diet of low-fat, low-calorie Subway sandwiches, and receive a pledge card good for sandwich discounts and a two-week free membership to Bally Total Fitness. ""That Jared s a nice guy,"" Pittman says. ""That s his full-time job now."" People would agree that losing weight is a full-time task. The city will also team up with the Texas Fruit and Produce Growers Association and Central Market to promote the ""Five a Day"" message of eating five serving of fruits and vegetables a day. That effort kicks off Jan. 22. ""We re not saying everyone has to run 10 miles a day around Memorial Park,"" Pittman says. ""We re talking just simple lifestyle changes."" Later this year, Houston will join other major Texas cities in a program called ""Shape Up Texas"" to improve health and wellness among Texans. That s not a bad idea considering Texas cities make up 20 percent of the fat list and four of the top eight. Mayor Lee Brown says he will do his part to cut out the fat at City Hall. Brown, who has put on a few pounds since taking office, says he isn t surprised by Houston s expansive reputation. ""I m afraid I ve contributed to that,"" he says. Brown says he will set an example for the rest of the city by losing some weight himself, not through a diet but by walking and riding his bike more.

We should have it at a place where we can get a semi-private room serving food and cocktails. The idea is to have a holiday party to get to know each other.  The origination team will also be signing holiday cards to send out to our customers, so we need to do it sooner (late Nov or early Dec), so the cards the be delivered.

The date will be fast upon us.  Also, I would like to order something like a Greenberg turkey for several of my better customers. Do you have a problem with that this year? If you like I could include several of your key customers as well. I also requested Michael get Morris a RIM as well as a phone. In case we miss each other Tuesday, I will be meeting with the VP of TotalFinaElf regarding supplying gas under the Frontera transaction, talking about several of their chemical plants in addition to discuss trading with them daily. After lunch I will be meeting with BP Amoco to talk about several plant deliveries as well as look at daily trading with them.

Here are my notes.  Did not yet have a chance to organize them, so they re simply in chronological order.The call began with Watson, Bergstrom, and Whalley reading from prepared statements.  Watson spoke for c. 10 minutes, Bergstrom for 5, and Whalley spoke for perhaps 30 seconds.  Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call.  Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them.  Specific points:EES will be a part of the new company.  Enron assets will be revalued at closing.  The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred.  If the merger does not go through, Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for  very little  additional consideration.  If DYN terminates the merger and ENE  has sufficient liquidity , ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred.  Debt/equity of combined company expected to be <45%.Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative.  ChevronTexaco will hold 169MM shares out of a total 650MM shares of the post-merger entity.  Watson reiterates that going forward, the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure, with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage.  In what was termed a ""new approach"", the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings.  Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true.  Dynegy owed Enron <$50MM.  Lay says that Enron had other options,  particularly financial .All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks.Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be  pretty big , but that the companies feel they re able to appropriately value this exposure.Lay says we have nothing else to hide, but internal investigation still under way.  Lay:  had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps $30MM more of risk capital, there would have been no question that they would have qualified for off-balance-sheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs.Dynegy says that  several  internal investigations continue at Enron, and thus DYN/ENE cannot say with certainty that there s absolutely nothing else out there.Doty (Dynegy CFO) says that late last week, ENE had  close to a billion  in cash.  Osprey will be unwound late next summer. Marlin will be unwound after closing.Many of the off-balance-sheet structures, including the credit-linked notes, are expected to be unwound/redeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing.With regard to ENE asset dispositions, these will be accelerated to the extent possible.  However, Doty says that  our backs are not against the wall , and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash.ENE will renew its 364-day facility (believe this is the $3Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago) within the next 6-8 weeks.  BBB-flat most likely rating for combined entity, according to initial comments from ratings agencies.McMahon says  no comment  to WSJ article indicating that ENE s banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks.Consolidation of trading activity: Mid- and back-office consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing, such that only the front office / trading books will need to be combined at closing.  EES, NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity, so there won t be much integration work required there.  The big integration effort will be ENA.Watson says that the  creative financing  surrounded non-core assets.  Doty adds that,  frankly , DYN assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model.  They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assets/businesses and left it at that.Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by  Enron s top three executives , who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies.  Says that their approach evidenced a  willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegy s deliberations on proceeding with the merger.Watson/Doty said that they re NOT 100% sure that no surprises remain in Enron s books--but that the risk/reward offered by the combination was compelling. The deal does have material-adverse-change outs for Dynegy, covering any MAC regarding Enron s assets or businesses.  Dynegy s lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a  blunt instrument  under which it would be difficult to bring a case, so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enron s total legal liability (from any source or cause of action) tops $3.5Bn prior to closing.McMahon adds that there  could  be more restatements, but he  does not expect  there to be more restatements.ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list.The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron.Enron is planning to hold an Enron-specific conference call in the next few days, tentatively scheduled for Wednesday.Initial reaction of ratings agencies  very positive  to combined entities.  McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end, had the merger not materialized.Dynegy s earnings guidance places Enron-related earnings accretion at $0.90-0.95, which represents a  25% haircut  to Enron internal estimates.  Doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies.Doty says that both Enron and Dynegy s books, as far as he understands, are relatively short-term in weight, and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity.  Says a  very very substantial  portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash.ChevronTexaco s investment in Dynegy was calculated at a 5% discount to public prices on the date of negotiation (not disclosed).  Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week, ChevronTexaco s investment is now at a  more substantial  discount to market prices.  ChevronTexaco has provision to get  different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better .  (No further clarification given).Whalley believes that  we ll retain  the Enron traders and marketers. They re used to being part of a winning team, and the combined entity will definitely be a winner.  They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders, and they are  very excited  by the combination.  They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained.  Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions.  He says that  to the extent necessary, yes. Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENE--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus, but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the Dynegy of today.Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture, he s a strong team player.  He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well.Give me a call if you d like me to try to clarify any of these comments.Patrick Tuckerx3-3055"

GLATER01/10/2002The New York TimesPage 1, Column 3c. 2002 New York Times Company<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = ""urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office"" />Widening the potential scope of the criminal investigation into the Enron Corporation, the Justice Department plans to form a special task force of prosecutors from across the country to conduct the inquiry into the company and its eventual collapse, government officials said yesterday. At the same time, the decision will reduce the burdens going forward on Enron, which has been struggling with the demands from multiple civil and criminal investigations. By consolidating the criminal investigations, the company will have only one coordinated group of prosecutors seeking information, decreasing the potential demands for documents and limiting the number of officials to persuade of its position.Legal experts said the decision to create such a task force on a white-collar case involving a single company was virtually unheard-of and signaled that the government might elevate the case to a level of significance usually reserved for investigations of entire industries. The task force will bring together prosecutors from several United States attorneys  offices -- including those in Houston, New York City and San Francisco -- with all of them reporting through the department s criminal division, officials said. In addition, prosecutors from the fraud section, part of the criminal division, will be part of the task force.   This is a case of national scope and national significance that is going to require coordination and manpower, and the task force is a way of achieving that,   one official said. Robert S. Bennett, a Washington lawyer who represents the company, said last night that he saw the department s decision as positive.   I m pleased that there now appears to be some centralization and coordination, because it is very difficult and expensive to deal with half a dozen different entities,   he said.   This is a company in bankruptcy, and it needs to be given a fair shot to come out of bankruptcy and increase the value for stakeholders. If we get caught in a cumbersome scandal machine, that may not happen.   While the decision to form the task force is final, many details have yet to be worked out, officials said. Some prosecutors involved in the case have not been notified of their specific roles in the task force, and other decisions about where the group will work and how the various strands of investigation will be coordinated have not been determined. The Justice Department has formed numerous task forces in the past, but they have usually focused either on complex cases of violent crime or conducted inquiries into practices by entire industries. Legal experts who have examined the Enron case said yesterday that by bringing together the disparate pieces of the sprawling criminal investigation of the company, the government is overcoming hurdles that might have hampered the inquiry if it was conducted in separate offices. For example, while federal prosecutors in Manhattan have the most experience in investigating complex white-collar cases, they might face difficulty in meeting the requirement that potential crimes took place in their geographical jurisdiction. And while prosecutors in Houston, where Enron is based, would have no such problems, they do not have the same experience in white-collar cases. By bringing the prosecutors together, while simultaneously adding the manpower from the department s fraud section, legal experts said, the government is raising the probability of indictments.   Prosecutors tend to indict what they investigate,   said John C. Coffee Jr., a law professor at Columbia University who has testified in Congress on the Enron case.   This kind of task force for an individual investigation is without precedent, and while it doesn t guarantee an indictment, it certainly raises the stakes.   But some past efforts by the Justice Department to take a more central role in a criminal investigation of a corporation with influence in Washington have raised concerns about potential political influence over the inquiry. For example, in the 1990 s, when part of an inquiry involving the Archer Daniels Midland Company was assigned to the fraud section, some critics contended -- to the vehement denials of Justice officials -- that Washington was trying to protect Archer, the politically influential grain company. Enron, whose officers have been close to both President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney, has exercised similar political influence in the past. In addition to the inquiry being conducted by the Justice Department, Enron s collapse is being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission and several Congressional committees. Meanwhile, in Enron s bankruptcy proceedings, parts of the company are now up for auction to the highest bidder. For example, an auction of its trading business is scheduled to take place today, and a spokeswoman said it should be presented to the bankruptcy court at a hearing tomorrow. But a speedy approval by the court is not assured. Several creditors have filed objections to the auction because they are worried that they will not have time to evaluate whether all or parts of the business will be sold at a fair price. Creditors have also expressed concern about what would happen to the proceeds from the sale. Creditors of Enron North America, the unit that owns the trading business, want to make sure that the money goes to them and is not distributed among all the company s creditors. In Houston yesterday, in a suit filed by investors against 29 Enron directors and officers, a federal judge dealt a setback to plaintiffs by declining to freeze more than $1 billion that they say the directors and officers gained from the sale of Enron shares while hiding information about the company s decline. However, the judge also told defendants that she had the power to freeze the assets if necessary. Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.  U.S. Puts Task Force on Criminal Probe of EnronBy Rebecca SmithStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal01/10/2002The Wall Street JournalA3(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)The Justice Department said a task force has been formed to pursue a criminal investigation of Enron Corp., confirming a probe that is expected to center on possible accounting fraud. The investigation will be run by the department s criminal division coordinating among U.S. Attorneys in New York City, San Francisco, Houston and elsewhere. The Wall Street Journal first reported the criminal investigation in early December.Enron, the nation s biggest marketer of electricity and natural gas, filed for bankruptcy-court protection following a crisis of confidence among its investors. The problems have resulted largely from Enron s dealings with private partnerships, run by some of its own executives. The company saw its market value plunge recently to about $540 million from more than $77 billion last year. The Securities and Exchange Commission, which has been investigating Enron since October, and the Justice Department could both file cases alleging violations of securities laws if Enron is found to have intentionally misled investors about its financial condition. Several Congressional committees also have begun inquiries into various aspects of Enron s collapse. Enron acknowledged that it is the target of a criminal investigation by the Justice Department. ""It has been the posture of the company to fully cooperate with government investigations,"" said Robert Bennett, an attorney with Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, which represents the company. ""At the end of day, I m pretty optimistic . . . an objective person will see that many of the things said and written [about Enron] aren t true."" Confirmation of the probe came even as nearly two dozen firms asked a U.S. bankruptcy-court judge to temporarily block Enron s intended sale of its energy-trading business, until recently the earnings juggernaut for the entire company. The court approved an auction process on Dec. 19 that was to have resulted in the announcement of the winning bidder as early as tomorrow. Bidders for pieces of Enron s energy-trading business, which still has a staff of about 1,000 people, include Citigroup Inc., UBS AG and BP PLC, people familiar with the matter have said. But a host of creditors have asked the court to delay the sale indefinitely. The list includes financial institutions such as Royal Bank of Scotland PLC and GE Capital Corp. as well as power-trading rivals such as Mirant Corp., El Paso Merchant Energy LP and Aquila Inc., a unit of Utilicorp United Inc. Aquila said it doesn t oppose the sale, per se, but wants guarantees that Enron will put the proceeds in an escrow account until a determination has been made about how it will be split among creditors. Mirant, Atlanta, in its pleadings with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, said the sales materials circulated by Enron lacked ""significant material information that is essential . . . to make an informed decision regarding the wisdom of the transaction."" The materials lack a minimum bid, which ""begs the question,"" Mirant said, ""as to whether there is a bid that is simply too low to accept or whether the debtors are preparing to sell at any price."" Challengers also questioned who would be responsible for liabilities excluded from the sale. Enron s energy-marketing unit, which includes its once-mighty EnronOnline Internet-based trading platform, traded dozens of products until recently and generated roughly 90% of the firm s earnings in the most recent quarter. It also was responsible for the bulk of Enron s 2001 revenue of $101 billion. In bankruptcy-court documents filed in December, Enron said the company s wholesale-trading business, of which the energy-trading unit is a major part, had assets of about $13 billion and liabilities of at least $8 billion. Concerns over Enron s financial strength and the integrity of its accounting practices caused trading partners to back away from doing business with it starting in mid-October. From that point on, a significant portion of Enron s trading volume came from customers trying to wind down their Enron-related positions. The unit ceased meaningful operations prior to Enron s Dec. 2 bankruptcy-court filing. Resuscitation will require a cash infusion from a trusted partner with a blue-chip credit rating, the company has said. It has proposed transferring assets to a new venture in which Enron would retain a 49% position. The new investor would control the partnership, that has been dubbed New Energy Trading Company LP. An Enron spokesman said the firm would press to go ahead with the proposal. ""It s in the best interest of Enron and its creditors to get the trading operation started as soon as possible to get as much value for the estate as possible,"" said spokesman Mark Palmer.

Jan. 9, 2002, 10:10PMU.S. opens criminal inquiry into EnronJustice sets up probe of financial collapse By DAVID IVANOVICH Copyright 2002 Houston Chronicle WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Justice Department acknowledged Wednesday it has launched a criminal investigation into the epic fall of Houston s Enron Corp. Attorneys from the Justice Department s fraud section, along with prosecutors from Houston, New York and San Francisco among other cities, will form a special task force to examine the collapse of the nation s seventh-largest company, a Justice official confirmed Wednesday. The energy and trading giant sought protection from its creditors on Dec. 2, becoming the largest bankruptcy case in U.S. corporate history. For weeks, the Justice Department has been known to be looking into the Enron debacle, as have the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Labor Department and a host of congressional panels. ""This is basically an issue of national scope,"" said the Justice official, who asked not to be identified. ""Because there have been so many questions about this and because there has been so much interest, we are simply acknowledging the investigation."" Robert Bennett, a Washington-based attorney representing Enron in the nation s capital, argued the Justice Department s action is actually ""a positive development."" ""There will be a unification and a structure to the investigation,"" Bennett said. ""We won t have to deal with six or seven different offices."" Since the company s dizzying fall, Enron has been overwhelmed by a blizzard of lawsuits, investigations and subpoenas. On Wednesday, the Senate Banking Committee became the sixth congressional panel to jump into the swirl of Enron investigations. Responding to fiascoes at companies such as Enron and Houston trash hauler Waste Management, the committee, headed by Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., plans to hold a hearing Feb. 12 to examine accounting and investor protections. Waste Management, which was accused of inflating corporate earnings, agreed in November to pay $457 million to settle a class-action suit. Andersen, Waste Management s auditor, agreed to pay a $7 million SEC fine and another $20 million to Waste Management shareholders for failing to catch the company s accounting excesses. Sarbanes  committee plans to call five former SEC heads to suggest ways to avoid future debacles. ""Enron is not the sole focus of the hearing,"" said Sarbanes  spokesman, Jesse Jacobs. Lawmakers have been clamoring for Enron Chief Executive Ken Lay and other Enron executives to appear before their panels, and they have vowed to subpoena them unless they agree to come voluntarily. Lay has promised to appear Feb. 4 before the Senate Subcommittee on Consumer Affairs. The House Energy and Commerce Committee has collected thousands of pages of documents and interviewed a number of current and former Enron officials. Prior to the company s collapse, Lay, a longtime supporter of President Bush, was one of the most politically influential businessmen in America with relatively easy access to the Bush White House. On Tuesday, Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., released a letter from Vice President Dick Cheney s office detailing six meetings between Enron executives and White House officials over an eight-month period. ""The Washington scandal machine is being pumped up, and everybody for their own reasons wants a piece of the action,"" said Bennett, who represented former President Clinton in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case. ""There s an unfortunate rush to judgment here,"" Bennett said. ""Hopefully, people will calm down a little bit and let these investigations proceed."" Enron s breathtaking collapse began in October, when the company revealed that $1.2 billion worth of shareholder equity had evaporated, largely because of the accounting treatment of some off-balance-sheet joint ventures. That news shook investor confidence in the company and began a free-fall of the company s stock. Joseph Berardino, head of Enron s outside auditor Andersen, told a House panel last month Enron officials failed to provide examiners with required information and may have committed ""possible illegal acts."" Enron employees and retirees have complained loudly about the loss of retirement funds because of the company s collapse. Participants in the company s 401(k) retirement plan were barred from selling their Enron shares just as the stock was nosediving because of management s decision to change plan administrators. The Justice Department s revelation about the criminal investigation task force comes just as Enron is scheduled today to hold an auction for a majority stake in the company s most lucrative operation, its trading business. Three firms, including Citigroup and UBS Warburg, submitted proposals Monday to take control of the trading operation. Other companies could join the bidding today in what industry analysts say could be a billion-dollar transaction.   Justice Department begins criminal probe of Enron collapseBy KAREN GULLOAssociated Press Writer01/10/2002Associated Press NewswiresCopyright 2002. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.WASHINGTON (AP) - The Justice Department has begun a criminal investigation of Enron Corp., the bankrupt energy company whose collapse caused many employees to lose their life s savings. An attorney for Enron welcomed the inquiry, the latest in a series of governmental probes into the company s demise, saying the investigation would ""bring light to the facts.""""We want to get to the bottom of this too,"" said Robert Bennett, a Washington attorney representing the Houston-based company. ""A lot of decent and honorable people work at Enron and we should wait until the facts are out."" The Justice Department is forming a national task force to look into the company s dealings. The group will be headed by lawyers at the department s criminal division and include prosecutors in Houston, San Francisco, New York and several other cities, said a Justice Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity. The official declined to say when the investigation began. Enron faces civil investigations by the Labor Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission and subpoenas from congressional committees. All are looking into the energy trading company s collapse, the largest bankruptcy filing in U.S. history. The failure hit employees and investors hard. Workers were prohibited from selling company stock from their Enron-heavy 401(k) retirement accounts as the company s stock plummeted. Many lost their life s savings. Enron executives cashed out more than $1 billion in stock when it was near its peak. Formed in 1985, Enron had 20,000 employees and was once the world s top buyer and seller of natural gas and the largest electricity marketer in the United States. It also marketed coal, pulp, paper, plastics, metals and fiber-optic bandwidth. One likely focus of the Justice Department investigation is possible fraud based on Enron s heavy reliance on off-balance-sheet partnerships which took on Enron debt. The partnerships masked Enron s financial problems and left its credit ratings healthy so it could obtain the cash and credit crucial to running its trading business. The Houston-based company went bankrupt after its credit collapsed and its main rival, Dynegy Inc., backed out of an $8.4 billion buyout plan late last year. Just a year ago, stock of the nation s largest buyer and seller of natural gas traded at $85 per share. Today it is less than $1. Enron Chairman Kenneth L. Lay has close ties to President Bush and his father, former President Bush. Lay was a top contributor to the younger Bush s 2000 presidential campaign. Last week, the president said: ""I think the life savings issue is something we need to look into. ... The government will be looking into this."" Lay also gave $25,000 to a leadership committee headed by then-senator and now Attorney General John Ashcroft, according to the Center for Public Integrity. The company played a key role earlier this year when a White House task force met with business executives and other interests to fashion a national energy policy. The task force was headed by Vice President Dick Cheney. The White House has acknowledged that Enron representatives met six times with Cheney or his aides on energy issues last year, most recently in mid-October just before the investing public realized the company was heading for disaster. The vice president s office said the last Enron meeting with a Cheney aide was Oct. 10, just six days before the first in a series of public admissions by the company about its true financial condition that sent it careening into bankruptcy court. Enron s financial position wasn t discussed in any of the meetings, vice presidential counsel David Addington said in a letter. On Wednesday, White House spokesman Ari Fleischer told reporters: ""I m not aware of anybody in the White House who discussed Enron s financial situation."" --- On the Net: http://www.Enron.com http://usdoj.gov AP Photo NY836 Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.  Jan. 10, 2002, 12:23AMJudge declines to freeze profits of Enron officers By TOM FOWLER Copyright 2002 Houston ChronicleA federal judge said Wednesday she has the authority to freeze hundreds of millions of dollars in assets that Enron Corp. insiders earned through selling their stock, but declined to do so. U.S. District Court Judge Lee Rosenthal cited a 1999 Supreme Court opinion for her authority to freeze the assets of the 29 Enron executives and board members named in a lawsuit filed on behalf of a number of worker retirement funds. But she ruled there were insufficient grounds for issuing such an order based on the evidence and arguments she has heard so far. In her ruling Rosenthal wrote she would not order the restraining order on the assets "" ... without allegations or evidence that each, or any, defendant has, or is likely to, conceal the stock sales proceeds or profits or place them beyond reach, absent immediate judicial intervention."" Enron officials were not immediately available for comment. The lawsuit, filed by New York-based Amalgamated Bank in November, alleges that Enron executives and board members sold $1.1 billion in Enron stock over the past three years while not disclosing that the stock price was overvalued. Amalgamated Bank manages pension funds that hold Enron stock. The lawsuit claims the company officials were aware of accounting problems that led to inflated earnings reports and higher stock prices. In November 2001, Enron reported it was adjusting its earnings for the past 4 1/2 years because of bookkeeping errors related to investment partnerships it had formed. That included a $586 million reduction in net income, adding $2.5 billion in debt to its books and a 77-cent reduction in earnings per share. ""We are gratified that we have cleared this important legal hurdle,"" said Amalgamated s attorney Bill Lerach in a statement Wednesday. ""We are also pleased that the court has held open the possibility that we may conduct discovery to obtain additional evidence to justify the requested injunction."" In a Dec. 7 hearing, Lerach asked the judge to freeze the assets of the Enron insiders, including Chairman and CEO Ken Lay and former Chief Executive Officer Jeff Skilling, claiming there was a danger they would flee the country with the profits from exercising their stock options. Lay netted $16.1 million in stock sales for the first nine months of 2001, according to data compiled by Thomson Financial/First Call, while Skilling collected $15.5 million. Attorneys representing Enron denied that their clients would do so and challenged the court s authority to freeze assets. In her ruling this week, Rosenthal ordered Amalgamated to file a brief in support of its request for expedited discovery into the case by Jan. 23 and for Enron and its executives to file a response by Feb. 6. VIEWPOINTSWhite House Was a Home For EnronRobert Reno01/10/2002NewsdayALL EDITIONSA36(Copyright Newsday Inc., 2002)PRESIDENT George W. Bush says he s had ""no contact with Enron officials in the last six weeks."" That s a relief. It shows he has sense enough to know when a corporation has turned radioactive and is best approached at the end of a 10-foot pole. Still, this leaves almost an entire year in which Enron officials waltzed in and out of the White House enjoying an unusual degree of access. The Washington Post reports that Vice President Dick Cheney or his aides found time to meet with Enron officials on six occasions in 2001.On the face of it, this may not even seem excessive for an administration in which corporate interests have been given an extraordinary degree of influence. And besides, David S. Addington, the vice president s counsel, wrote a letter insisting that ""Enron did not communicate information about its financial position in any of the meetings with the vice president or with the National Energy Development Group s support staff."" That s a relief as well. Since Enron s financial troubles weren t discussed, this presumably shows Enron wasn t looking for some squalid favor that would permit it to avoid one of the most spectacular bankruptcies in history. It was probably just seeking to influence some government action that would advance the general interests of Enron, perhaps relief from some obnoxious regulation promulgated in the Clinton administration that stood between Enron and its ambitions to become the world s largest corporation. And in the energy-friendly Bush administration, what more logical place to come than the White House? Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) can be forgiven his cynicism about these Enron meetings. He said, ""It shows Enron far exceeded the access provided by the White House to other parties interested in energy policy."" Certainly, it exceeds the access that would be granted to, say, a bunch of high-minded old ladies in hand-knitted sweaters pleading against a rape of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Anyway, White House officials said the Enron meetings reflected nothing more sinister than the ""open and inclusive"" policy of the vice president s energy task force. They made it sound like all the meetings had taken place in plain sight on the White lawn. Anyway, the Enron meetings continued until just days before the company started to collapse. Cheney s aides met with executives of Enron s German subsidiary on Aug. 7 and with Enron officials on Oct. 10. Six days later, Enron s troubles became news, and the shell of its assets became transparent to the world. A little more than a month later, Enron announced $55 million in bonuses to 500 key employees. Another 4,000 employees got pink slips and $4,500 in severance pay to console them for 401(k) balances that had become close to worthless because the bulk of it was in Enron shares. This gave off an odor of favoritism until it was explained that somebody had to be induced to stay around and pick over the bones of Enron s carcass for what assets could be preserved. The $55 million began to look like a small price to pay for this, considering that last year the corporation had $101 billion in sales. Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. USA: White House says seeking post-Enron policies.01/09/2002Reuters English News Service(C) Reuters Limited 2002.WASHINGTON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - The White House on Wednesday said it was likely to soon propose new policies to guard against a repeat of the bankruptcy of Enron Corp., which has prompted a Justice Department criminal probe. White House spokesman Ari Fleischer, asked about the probe, told Reuters it was important to get to the bottom of the Enron collapse and develop new policies to protect workers and pensioners.""It s important for the investigation to proceed to determine what was done and why it was done. The president also believes it s important to explore new policies so it (a similar collapse) can never happen again,"" Fleischer said.

USA: Enron creditors gearing up for haggling at auction.By Dane Hamilton01/09/2002Reuters English News Service(C) Reuters Limited 2002.NEW YORK, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Creditors of Enron Corp. have shifted into high gear in anticipation of an expected intense day of haggling Thursday when the bankrupt energy company auctions off its trading operations. So far, two financial bidders, Citicorp Inc. and UBS Warburg , have submitted bids for the Houston-based company s biggest business, sources said. But both Enron and creditors are hoping other companies may jump into the fray for all or parts of Enron s electricity and gas trading operations.To take part, a bidder needs only to submit a sealed bid and a certified check for $25 million, to be returned if the bid is not chosen. British oil giant BP Plc , for instance, said it is interested in a small part, but not all, of Enron s trading operations, but left the door open to enlarge its bid later. The auction is set to take place at 10 a.m. at the New York office of Enron s attorneys, Weil Gotshal & Manges. Enron lawyers will evaluate bids with a 15-member unsecured creditors committee and could present its recommendations to U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Arthur Gonzales Friday. Enron, once the world s biggest energy trading company, is seeking a well-heeled backer to take a controlling stake in the Enron trading operations and guarantee contracts. The company, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Dec. 2, is aiming to revive the moribund trading operations to generate cash to pay off creditors. It is hoping eventually to emerge from the debt shield under Chapter 11, a prospect that can take months or years. Thursday s auction is likely to be a drawn-out affair, where negotiators will likely pressure bidders to sweeten offers by playing them off against each other. ""This is not like Sothebys,"" said one member of Enron s unsecured creditors committee, a panel chosen by a U.S. Bankruptcy Court trustee to represent the interests of banks, bondholders and other stakeholders in Enron. ""It could go on all day and conceivably into the night."" This committee member, who asked for anonymity, said Enron lawyers and the committee could agree on a bidder or ask for more time. Or they could decide Enron is better off keeping the business. A key point of discussions this week was the distribution of the proceeds of cash flow from a revival of Enron s trading operation, which generated the bulk of Enron s $95 billion in 2000 revenue in wholesale services, by far its largest division, people familiar with the discussions said. But these people denied news reports that characterized the discussions as a dispute with Enron and said any issues are likely to be resolved in a way that will not hold up the auction. ""This is a very extreme and inaccurate statement of fact to suggest there is a dispute,"" said one creditor representative. ""We are undertaking due diligence to support the right action. That is what we are supposed to be doing as a creditors committee."" Another committee member said creditors have asked for more information on the nature and extent of the bids on the table. But this member said there is a general agreement to resolve the issues as soon as possible. ""I don t think we have enough information now as to whether we should endorse this sale,"" said this member. But he said there is agreement to expedite the sale in the hopes of reviving Enron s most valuable operation. ""The longer you wait, the staler the trading operation becomes,"" he said. This member said there have been objections filed in the U.S. bankruptcy court to the sale of the trading operations. But those objections were filed before any bids came in. He said it seemed ""questionable"" to object to a sale that may benefit the bankrupt company s estate without knowing the offer. Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. USA: UPDATE 1-GAO to decide within month on White House suit.By Susan Cornwell01/09/2002Reuters English News Service(C) Reuters Limited 2002.WASHINGTON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - The head of the U.S. Congress  investigative arm said on Wednesday he would decide within a month whether to sue the White House over its refusal to name industry executives the administration met with last year while drafting its new energy policy. Comptroller General David Walker had been heading for a court clash with the administration last year, but postponed a decision after the Sept. 11 hijack attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.Now, any decision by him to sue would add to Capitol Hill s scrutiny of the collapsed energy giant, Enron , whose executives the White House has acknowledged consulting while drawing up its energy plan. Citing the right of Congress to oversee the executive branch, Walker, head of the General Accounting Office, began trying last May to get details of the workings of the administration task force that drew up the energy program. Environmental groups say they were mostly shut out of the sessions of the task force, which was headed by Vice President Dick Cheney. They suspect private sector experts such as Enron heavily influenced the Bush energy plan. Enron was a major backer of Bush s election campaign, Bush himself is a former oil man, and Cheney was formerly head of Halliburton Co. , the world s No. 1. oilfield services company. The policy announced by Bush in May urged more oil and gas drilling and a revived nuclear power program. But the White House says it consulted widely in its energy policy review. And the White House largely rebuffed the GAO s efforts to get the information about the National Energy Policy Development Group (NEPDG), as the task force was called. ""I expect to make a decision on whether to file suit regarding GAO s access to NEPDG records within a month,"" Walker said in a brief statement on Wednesday. Walker began his probe of the energy task force after Rep. Henry Waxman and Rep. John Dingell, both Democrats, asked him to investigate. ENRON DRAWS SCRUTINY Recently the energy task force controversy had seemed to all but evaporate. Then last month Waxman seized on the spectacular collapse of Enron to write to Cheney s office again and ask what contacts the task force had with Enron. The White House said in a letter released on Tuesday that Cheney or the energy task force staff met six times with Enron representatives last year. Walker s spokesman Jeff Nelligan refused to be say whether the White House s revelations about Enron - or the five congressional committees probing Enron - made a GAO lawsuit over the energy task force more or less likely. In any case, Waxman is seeking more information from the White House about its Enron contacts. White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said on Wednesday the vice president s office was reviewing the new request from Waxman. ""I m not aware of anybody in the White House who discussed Enron s financial situation,"" Fleischer added. Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Editorial Desk; Section AJoined at the HipBy BOB HERBERT01/10/2002The New York TimesPage 27, Column 5c. 2002 New York Times CompanyYou ll have to look long and extremely hard to come up with an example of corporate treachery in the United States that s as horrible as the Enron debacle. This is a scandal with a very broad reach and it has some of the wise guys in the Bush administration and other top Republicans trembling in their penny loafers. Enron was a bonanza for -- whom else? -- the folks at the top of the pyramid. They ferociously exploited their gilt-edged political connections and harvested breathtaking amounts of cash for themselves, even as the company was collapsing into the biggest bankruptcy mess in U.S. history. Left behind were thousands of ordinary working men and women, people with families and obligations, who lost jobs, life savings, pensions, the works. And more carnage is to come.The fallout is nationwide. A week before Christmas, Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, spoke about the gloom that had settled over workers in his state who watched their retirement funds vanish.   Because of what happened at Enron,   he said,   there are Oregon families going to grief counseling rather than holiday parties this year.   No one knows yet the extent of the illegality -- if any -- that went on at Enron. The Justice Department announced yesterday that it was launching a criminal investigation. But there is no doubt that many of the company s top officials swam, as a matter of course, in an ethical sewer. They were pals with, and lavishly greased the palms of, powerful people who were willing to guide government policy toward Enron s ends, and who could help the company escape close scrutiny of its more sinister activities. The Center for Public Integrity, a nonpartisan watchdog agency in Washington, examined the political contributions of 29 top Enron executives and directors named in a shareholder lawsuit filed against the company last month. Twenty-four of the 29 made contributions from 1999 to 2001 -- totaling nearly $800,000 -- to George W. Bush, members of Congress, the two national political parties (with the bulk of the contributions going to the Republicans) and a variety of officials who are now responsible for investigating possible securities fraud by Enron. Of the five who did not make contributions, two were foreign nationals prohibited by law from contributing to candidates or parties.   The folks at the top of the company gave lavishly,   said Charles Lewis, the center s executive director.   It just shows that this is a company inordinately dependent on government favors.   And how did these generous Enron officials behave as the apocalypse approached? The shareholders  suit, as the center noted in its study,   alleges that the 29 executives and directors dumped $1.1 billion worth of stock while knowing the company was in danger of collapse.   Defendants in the lawsuit have disputed the charges against them. But there is no disputing that as Enron toppled and fell, insiders unloaded hundreds of millions of dollars  worth of stock while rank-and-file Enron employees were locked into rules that left many of them helpless as the stock s value plunged from more than $90 a share to less than $1. It has long been known that Enron and its chairman, Kenneth Lay, were close to President Bush. In Mr. Lewis s book,   The Buying of the President 2000,   Enron was already listed as Mr. Bush s No. 1 career patron. This week the office of Vice President Dick Cheney reluctantly disclosed that Enron executives met with Mr. Cheney or his aides at least six times as the Bush administration -- with Mr. Cheney in charge -- was putting together its national energy policy. It will be interesting to find out, as this scandal continues to unfold, how aggressively the Justice Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission and other appropriate agencies investigate a company that has been as generous and as wired and as powerfully influential as Enron. There s already talk that Harvey Pitt, the chairman of the S.E.C., may have to recuse himself because as a lawyer in private practice he did work for Arthur Andersen, the company that audited Enron s books with its eyes closed. Enron is a case study in the dangers that will inevitably arise when unrestrained corporate greed is joined at the hip with the legalized bribery and influence-peddling that passes for government these days.

E-mail: arianna@ariannaonline.com.01/10/2002Los Angeles TimesHome EditionB-15Copyright 2002 / The Times Mirror CompanySo now we know why the White House has spent the better part of a year fending off congressional efforts to find out who Vice President Dick Cheney met with for input on his energy task force. Turns out that the vice president and his staff had at least six meetings with representatives from Enron--including one with Chairman Kenneth L. Lay--the last of which occurred just six days before the company revealed that it had vastly overstated its earnings, signaling the beginning of the end for the energy giant. Since the Enron collapse, President Bush has been acting like Lay was just some good ol  boy who also happened to hail from Texas. This new information proves otherwise: that Lay and his company s sizable political contributions had bought what Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Los Angeles) has termed ""extensive access"" to the epicenter of American political power. It s Teapot Dome, the Sequel.During his run for the White House, Bush fought long and hard to convince us that he was a new breed of conservative--a Compassionate Conservative. But recent events make clear that he is actually the standard-bearer of a far more coldhearted breed. Call them the Enron Conservatives. Enron Conservatives are people who use political money and connections as levers to free themselves of all accountability to laws, regulations and responsibility--even to their own employees. Simply put, they are people who consistently, shamelessly and aggressively put their self-interest above the public interest. And when the lives of others are destroyed in the process, they just look the other way and hope that the law does too. And, all too often, it does. It probably is too much to expect the Federal Trade Commission to hop on the Enron investigation bandwagon and look into whether Bush violated truth-in-labeling laws during his campaign, when his pledges of compassionate conservatism were stump speech favorites. But it should. Because we ve heard precious little of them since Bush took the oath of office. ""While many of our citizens prosper,"" the freshly anointed president said in his inaugural address a year ago, ""others doubt the promise, even the justice, of our own country."" And those nagging doubts are only aggravated by the behavior of Enron executives who continue to prosper even as thousands watch their jobs--and their life s savings--disappear. Candidate Bush was so eager to paint himself as a Compassionate Conservative that he even dared to impugn the moral supremacy of the free market--blasphemy in the eyes of his party s doctrinaire right wing. ""The invisible hand works many miracles,"" said Bush during the summer of 1999, evoking Adam Smith s famous paean to market forces, ""but it cannot touch the human heart."" This simple truth lies at the core of the need for fair and rational government regulation of industry. All too often, after all, the human heart is filled not with goodness but with greed, selfishness and a desire for profit at any cost. Too bad Bush left this noble idea on the campaign trail. Since taking office, the hallmark of his administration has been an unwavering belief in the free market s invisible hand. In the last year, the president and his anti-regulatory appointees have (take a breath): abandoned a campaign promise to regulate carbon dioxide; repealed workplace ergonomic rules designed to improve worker safety; proposed reversing regulations protecting 60 million acres of national forest from logging and road building; and canceled a looming deadline for auto makers to develop prototype high-mileage cars. And that s just a partial list. Not even the rapacious excesses of the Enron debacle have quelled the drive for deregulation--or the ardor of Enron Conservatives who champion the cause. Pat Wood, Lay s handpicked choice to head the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, insists that the collapse of Enron ""doesn t seem to be tied too much to deregulated energy markets."" You know that something is rotten in Washington when the top energy industry regulator is so unabashedly anti-regulation. Rep. Joe Barton (R-Texas), chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, is another Enron Conservative who sees the energy giant s collapse as an aberration, not a smoking gun. He dismisses Enron s demise as ""an in-house problem"" and continues slaving away on a deregulation bill that would make Lay proud. Then there s Lawrence Lindsey, the president s top economic advisor and a former advisor to Enron, who went so far as to claim that the Enron disaster ""is a tribute to American capitalism."" And Sept. 11 was a tribute to Islamic ingenuity. Not that long ago, Bush was vowing to battle domestic suffering with ""armies of compassion."" Instead, he and his cadre of Enron Conservatives are adding to the carnage. Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.  EDITORIALEDITORIALSCheney s closed doors01/10/2002The San Francisco ChronicleFINALA.18(Copyright 2002)NOW THAT Enron faces a federal investigation in the wake of its largest-ever bankruptcy, it s time for Vice President Dick Cheney to explain fully his closed-door meetings with the fallen energy giant. After a ridiculous insistence on secrecy, Cheney acknowledges that, yes, he and his advisers met with Enron before and after writing an industry-friendly report on energy. The guest list at sessions of Cheney s energy task force was kept secret, most likely to cover the oil and gas interests who prepped the White House on what to write.The Enron-Cheney get-togethers aren t a huge surprise. Enron and its employees gave $113,800 to the Bush presidential campaign in 2000. CEO Ken Lay was a confidant of the president, offering advice on choices for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and extolling deregulation of electricity prices in the depths of the California energy crisis. The result of the meetings was an energy blueprint produced by Cheney tilted heavily to more drilling, exploration and coal mining, and dismissing energy conservation. The repeated Enron meetings lend more substance to claims that the White House is on autopilot when it comes to energy: oil and gas interests come first, and there s no need to study any other options. Cheney s clumsy delays in acknowledging Enron s access is a reminder of the White House s tunnel vision on the topic. But the meetings dredge up another embarrassing matter: Did Enron hint at its collapsing finances that ended in bankruptcy last month? Cheney claims Enron s money troubles never came up. But given the company s insider status, it s worth pursuing further. Did the White House have advance word of the company s deepening problems that made it the largest bankruptcy in history? Thousands of angry stockholders and employees may want to know more about Enron s -- and Cheney s -- conduct. Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.  CaliforniaMysteries of the Energy Plan01/10/2002Los Angeles TimesHome EditionB-14Copyright 2002 / The Times Mirror CompanyFor months, the White House has refused to hand over any information about the closed-door meetings of Vice President Dick Cheney s energy task force--a group that was heavy on energy executives, including Enron Corp. Chief Executive Kenneth L. Lay. Both Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) and the congressional General Accounting Office have insisted that the workings of the task force be disclosed. The White House has steadfastly maintained it is not obligated to do so. But considering the impact of the energy recommendations issued in May, from drilling for oil in Arctic wilderness to weakening the Clean Air Act, Americans should be privy to the making of these decisions. The collapse of Enron Corp., which has led to a federal criminal investigation, just bolsters the argument. The links between administration officials and Enron, starting with President Bush s own ties to the now-disgraced Lay, are going to get deserved scrutiny from several congressional committees. Democrats are gleeful at having such a fat target in a congressional election year. Yet the White House continues releasing too little, too late.In a Jan. 3 letter to Waxman, White House counsel David S. Addington states that Cheney or members of his energy task force met six times with Enron executives. Once Cheney met with Lay. All of the meetings may have been perfectly innocent. But the adamant refusal of the White House to explain what took place not only creates the appearance of impropriety but also illuminates a dangerous penchant for secrecy. Whether it s keeping Congress out of the loop or preventing historians from examining past presidential papers, this is too often the administration mind-set. Some of Waxman s requests may be picayune. He is asking, for example, about any communication that may have taken place between Cheney and Lay at a panel discussion on energy matters held at an American Enterprise Institute forum in Colorado in June. But the bulk of Waxman s questions are not unreasonable. Given the enormity of the Enron collapse and the company s seeming role in determining U.S. energy policy, it seems fair to ask for details about the meetings, any requests for changes in federal policies by Enron executives, copies of documents presented and the names of those attending. The vice president s office obviously doesn t see it that way. White House counsel Addington ends his paltry letter to Waxman by saying, ""It is our hope that submission of [this] information will help you avoid the waste of time and taxpayer funds on unnecessary inquiries."" This is maximum spin. Both Congress and the public deserve a full accounting of the administration s dealings with Enron. The fastest way to avoid wasting time and taxpayer money is for the White House to come clean. Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.  UK: Wall St seen inching up, Enron dives in Europe.01/10/2002Reuters English News Service(C) Reuters Limited 2002.LONDON, Jan 10 (Reuters) - U.S. shares were expected to creep higher on Thursday as investors held to the sidelines awaiting a flood of corporate earnings next week for guidance, and failed energy giant Enron Corp slid in Europe. March futures contracts pointed to a slightly firmer start on Wall Street with the Dow Jones blue-chip index up 15 points at 10,091 and the tech-laden Nasdaq rose 6.5 points to 1,662. Dealers at electronic brokerage Instinet said shares in Enron fell 17 percent to 65 cents in light volume from a 79 cents close after the U.S. Justice Department opened a criminal investigation of Enron, amid controversy over its collapse.On Wednesday officials declined to say exactly when the criminal probe began. But they said it was centered in the department s criminal division and that a task force was being set up to handle the case. Robert Bennett, attorney for Enron, said, ""When this investigation is finished, a lot of the things that people are reading and hearing will be proven to be not true."" Dealers said there was very little volume in the market and they expected a wash-out day with little corporate news or economic data to determine the health of corporate America. ""The U.S. indices tried to test their upper resistance levels and failed miserably on Wednesday. The Dow came nowhere near 10,300 and the Nasdaq almost but not quite made 2,100,"" said Tom Hougaard at Financial Spreads. ""The punishment for this failure was severe and we closed below the lows of the days before. Technically this was a failure and should take prices even lower,"" he added. Elsewhere, traders in London said there were modest rises in General Electric Company , up 10 cents at $38.65, Cisco rose 15 cents and Sun Microsystems was also marginally higher. Dealers said they expected shares in JNI Corp to remain under pressure after the provider of enterprise storage connectivity products said on Wednesday it would report a wider-than-expected fourth quarter loss.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Enron Sees Court OK For Asset Sale Despite ObjectionsBy Kathy Chu01/10/2002Dow Jones Energy Service(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Beleaguered Enron Corp. (ENE) doesn t expect a flurry of creditor objections to significantly hurt its chances of getting court approval to sell its core energy-trading operations.Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez, of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York, is scheduled to hear Enron s motion to shed part of its crown jewels Friday. The hearing follows a competitive auction of the energy business planned for Thursday. ""We expect the hearing to go forward,"" said Brian Rosen, of Weil, Gotshal & Manges law firm, which represents the bankrupt company. Once the company and its official creditors committee have agreed upon a suitor for the struggling business and submits the offer to the court, approval should follow shortly thereafter, according to Rosen. The sale is seen as an important step in reviving Enron s energy-trading operations, which generated about 90% of the company s $101 billion in revenue last year. Enron hopes that a creditworthy partner will take a 51% stake in the business, to be renamed New Energy Trading Co., while Enron maintains a 49% stake. The idea: to bring business back to what was once the nation s dominant natural gas and electricity trader. For their part, many of the creditors that filed objections - because of concern over which assets will be affected and what will be done with the proceeds of any sale - said it s likely they ll be able to resolve their differences with Enron ahead of or during Friday s court hearing. ""I think that most of the concerns will be answered quickly,"" said Aaron Cahn, of Carter Ledyard & Milburn law firm, which represents a consortium of oil creditors that had requested clarification of which assets will be sold, among other requests. Enron has said that it expects multiple bids for the energy-trading unit s hardware and software - including its valuable online trading platform - but not for the unit s trading book, the value of which the company estimates at $5 billion to $7 billion. This alleviates the concerns of some creditors who were uncertain about whether the sale would affect their trading contracts with Enron. Also, since proceeds from the sale are likely to come in as ""future revenue stream,"" according to Weil, Gotshal s Rosen, there may not be any immediate cash to put into escrow, as Enron creditors, including Wiser Oil Co., have requested. If an all-cash order is received and approved by the company and its creditors  committee, then Enron will look to the court to decide how the proceeds will be handled, said Rosen. Whatever happens, Enron and its advisors feel the energy-business sale needs to take place as soon as possible. Delayed approval of the transaction could jeopardize the value of the energy-trading operations  assets, Enron has said. Also, while most of Enron North America s traders are still with the company, there s no guarantee that they ll stay indefinitely. If the company and its creditors committee can agree upon a suitor at Thursday s auction, then information about the bid will be forwarded to interested parties - including objecting creditors - for review before the Friday hearing. More than a dozen companies have expressed concern about the proposed sale, including Royal Bank of Scotland, General Electric Co. s (GE) General Electric Corp., Eco-Tankship Inc. and El Paso Corp. s (EP) El Paso Merchant Energy LP. ""Many of the objections should disappear when people have more information,"" said James Beldner, an attorney for Enron retiree Michael Moran, an individual who sits on the committee and represents deferred compensation-plan holders. -Kathy Chu; Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5392; kathy.chu@dowjones.com (Carol S.

287073,2002-01-11 15:35:41,"X-FileName: tom martin 6-25-02.PSTTop Of The News The Enron Chain Saw Massacre Dan Ackman, Forbes.com, 01.11.02, 8:16 AM ET The Enron scandal is becoming more and more like a horror movie: It s not what s on screen that scares you, it s the unseen monster in the dark. Yesterday, Enron s accountants and the presidential Cabinet officers added to the scare and sent the burgeoning scandal in new directions. Arthur Andersen, the esteemed accounting firm, admitted it had destroyed Enron documents. That s bad, but what Arthur Andersen says it doesn t know may be worse. It says the records included ""a significant but undetermined number of electronic and paper documents and correspondence."" The firm goes on to say, ""After receiving [an] SEC subpoena, the firm issued an instruction to preserve documents."" What, one wonders, was Andersen s ""instruction"" before it received the subpoena--to destroy Enron documents with abandon? Did the accountants comply with the directive to preserve the documents? Andersen doesn t know: ""At this time, we have not been able to determine whether that instruction was violated,"" the firm says in a statement. Andersen says it has ""also asked former U.S. Sen. John Danforth to conduct an immediate and comprehensive review of Andersen s records management policy and to recommend improvements."" It does not say how much it is paying Danforth for his counsel, but it can have this policy tip for nothing: Don t destroy documents related to a scandal that led to a bankruptcy that wiped out $70 billion in shareholder value. These unanswered questions are part of a pattern with Enron. No one really knows how it got so rich, or what it was doing with the many private partnerships managed by its executives. No one knows what prompted former Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling to quit the company in August 2001. Indeed, at a bankruptcy court hearing earlier this week, it was revealed that Enron does not know the location of 79 of its top executives or even if they still work for the company. Separately, the White House revealed that Kenneth Lay, Enron s chairman, called Treasury Secretary Paul O Neill and Commerce Secretary Don Evans to warn them of the company s looming bankruptcy. This disclosure came with an additional announcement that Attorney General John Ashcroft has recused himself from the criminal investigation of Enron because of contributions he s received from company executives. Ari Fleischer, the White House press secretary, said Lay telephoned O Neill amid Enron s collapse ""to advise him about his concern about the obligations of Enron and whether they would be able to meet those obligations.   Lay added that Enron ""was heading to bankruptcy,   Fleischer said. O Neill received calls from Lay on Oct. 28 and Nov. 8, said Treasury Spokeswoman Michele Davis. By then, Enron made its stunning disclosure of a $638 million third-quarter loss. Still, as of Oct. 28, Enron was still trading at over $15 per share. In a separate phone call to Don Evans, Lay similarly worried about the default on its bank and bond debt. He ""was having problems with his bond rating and he was worried about its impact on the energy sector,   Fleischer said. Fleischer did not say what Evans or O Neill told Lay, but they spoke to each other ""and they both agreed no action should be taken to intervene with their bond holders,   and indeed no action was taken. The spokesman had said earlier he did not know of anyone in the White House who discussed Enron s financial situation. Did he even ask--or was not knowing the better option? Ashcroft stepped aside from the criminal investigation of Enron because he received campaign contributions from Enron executives during his campaign for the U.S. Senate in 2000. In addition to contributing to Ashcroft s senatorial campaign, Lay also gave $25,000 to a leadership committee headed by then-senator Ashcroft, according to the Center for Public Integrity. Enron, Lay and other executives have also been major contributors to President George Bush, both during his 2000 presidential campaign and during his runs for the Texas statehouse. Prior to Lay s contacts with O Neill and Evans, Enron officials had extensive contact with Vice President Dick Cheney and his aides, when they worked together on a response to a much ballyhooed but quickly deflated energy crisis <http://forbes.com/2001/05/02/0502nocrisis.html> in the spring of 2001. Trying to insulate himself from the scandal, President Bush has ordered a review headed by O Neill of U.S. pension and corporate disclosure rules. That review is intended, the administration says, to avoid a repeat of the energy-trading firm s collapse, in which thousands of employees lost most or all of their life savings. But Fleischer dismissed suggestions that the Justice Department investigation announced earlier this week should give way to a probe by an independent counsel. The president, for his part, saw Lay at a Houston charity event last spring at the White House with other business leaders last year. But he said he never discussed Enron s finances. ""I have never discussed with Mr. Lay the financial problems of the company,"" Bush said yesterday. ""I have not met with him personally."" That s good: The last thing you want to do in a horror movie is meet with the villain alone.

USA: UPDATE 1-Enron spread the wealth around Washington.By Susan Cornwell01/11/2002Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2002. WASHINGTON, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Former energy-trading giant Enron Corp. not only lavished campaign donations on President George W. Bush, but was one of America s biggest political contributors, spreading money across both parties on Capitol Hill. Nearly half the current U.S. House of Representatives and almost three-quarters of the current Senate have been beneficiaries of Enron largesse in recent years, say the Washington watchdog groups that monitor campaign cash.Since 1989, Enron has made a whopping $5.8 million in campaign donations, 73 percent to Republicans and 27 percent to Democrats, says the Center for Responsive Politics, an organization that tracks political giving. Nearly half of these funds were donated during 1999-2000, when Enron was one of the top 50 organizational donors in the United States, the Center says. The money kept coming in until just before Enron filed for bankruptcy on Dec. 2. Since then, as the controversy around Enron has grown, some donations have been given back. Texans were by far the biggest Enron recipients, and Republicans got more than Democrats. Bush, being both a Texan and a Republican, and a friend of Enron chairman Kenneth Lay to boot, did very well. Enron was Bush s biggest political patron as he headed into the 2000 presidential election. In all it has made $623,000 in contributions to his campaigns since 1993, when he was raising money for his first Texas gubernatorial race, according to the Center for Public Integrity, another follow-the-money group.  MONEY FOR ACCESS  But the giving did not stop after election day. Enron officials contributed $10,500 to his Florida recount committee, and when the recount was ended, they donated $300,000 for the inaugural celebrations, said Holley Bailey, researcher for the Center for Responsive Politics. ""I think what is interesting about their giving over the last year, is that they used any method possible to support President Bush s campaign run,"" she said. What Enron got in exchange for the money was access, Bailey asserted. She noted that Lay had met Vice President Dick Cheney during last year s California energy crisis, at the same time the administration was formulating its energy policy. ""One thing is clear. They have written checks to a lot of people in this town and I guess that gets their phone calls answered when they call Cabinet secretaries,"" Bailey said. It was disclosed this week that Lay telephoned two Cabinet officials last fall as the company s financial situation worsened. Enron on Dec. 2 made the largest bankruptcy court filing in U.S. history. The Justice Department has opened a criminal probe into Enron s collapse, which wiped out the pensions of thousands, and several congressional committees are also investigating. MIDAS TOUCH The White House points out, accurately, that Enron also contributed money to lawmakers, Democrats among them. Indeed, on Capitol Hill, few have escaped Enron s Midas touch. Texas Senators Kay Bailey Hutchison and Phil Gramm, both Republicans, top the list, having received $99,500 and $97,350 respectively in campaign contributions from Enron, the Center for Responsive Politics says. But senior Democrats and those on committees relevant to Enron s energy-trading business got donations too. For example, Sen. Charles Schumer of New York, a Democrat, received $21,933, the Center said. He is on the energy committee. Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota received $6,000 in Enron contributions. Democratic Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, who chairs the governmental affairs committee that will probe Enron s fall, got a $2,000 donation. In the House, the top beneficiary of Enron generosity, Democrat Ken Bentsen of Texas, has received $42,750 in contributions since he was elected in 1994. But Bentsen is giving back $2,000 of Enron money he has received since the last election - not to Enron, though. He is looking for a fund that will help its laid-off employees. He s not the only one shunning Enron money now. The National Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee as well as the Republican Governors Association recently returned Enron donations totaling $160,000. And the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee is giving to charity a $100,000 Enron donation that it received in late November, just days before Enron filed for bankruptcy. Asked why he topped the House list of Enron recipients, Bentsen explained that his district is in the greater Houston area, where Enron is based, and that he has had to raise a lot of money over his career fighting well-financed challengers. ""The bottom line is somedays I ve enjoyed support from Enron and other days I haven t,"" Bentsen added. He recalls Lay supported his opponent, Dolly Madison McKenna, in 1996. ""He (Lay) said,  I think she s going to be better than you.  It really made me mad,"" Bentsen said...................................................................................................................................... Senator Says Panel to Subpoena Enron And Arthur Andersen, Among OthersBy Jocelyn Parker01/11/2002Dow Jones Business News (Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) Dow Jones Newswires DETROIT -- U.S. Sen. Carl Levin said Friday a congressional panel will issue 51 subpoenas to embattled energy-trading giant Enron Corp., its auditor Arthur Anderson, and others following Anderson s disclosure it destroyed documents related to its work for Enron.At a press briefing in Detroit, Mr. Levin (D., Mich.), said the Anderson subpoena will require that the firm submit all information, including e-mails and other documents. The return date on the subpoena is Jan. 31. ""It is troubling that when there s an investigation going on that they (Arthur Anderson) would destroy the documents of their clients,"" Mr. Levin told reporters. Mr. Levin said he learned about the destruction of documents Thursday. Enron (ENE) hasn t responded to the subpoenas. Enron, Houston, went from a being a darling of Wall Street to making the largest bankruptcy filing in the nation s history in December. The Justice Department is investigating the company because of questions about the company s accounting practices and possible criminal wrongdoing. ""The criminal investigation by the Department of Justice is not surprising in light of what is known so far,"" Mr. Levin said in a statement. Mr. Levin also said at the briefing that it s likely that the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations will learn about other things that will ""no doubt lead to other subpoenas."" -- By Jocelyn Parker, Dow Jones Newswires; 313-963-7810 Copyright (c) 2002 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Federal Judge Declines To Transfer Enron Case To HoustonBy Kathy Chu01/11/2002Dow Jones News Service (Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- A federal bankruptcy judge declined to transfer beleaguered Enron Corp. s (ENE) bankruptcy case to Houston - as some creditors have requested - giving the company its second taste of victory Friday.The move, by Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez, of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York, was widely expected by many bankruptcy experts and is an attempt to maintain stability for a case that s almost six weeks old. Earlier Friday, Enron said that Swiss bank UBS AG has agreed to buy part of the bankrupt company s energy-trading operations. This deal is considered vital to reviving a stagnant business that generated 90% of the company s $101 billion in revenue last year. In his 42-page ruling issued late Friday, Judge Gonzalez said New York is the ""most efficient forum"" for administering Enron s bankruptcy case. ""New York is a world financial center, and as such, has the resources that will be required to address the debtors  financial issues,"" he said. Also, because the parties ""most essential"" to reorganization are here, it makes sense for the court to retain jurisdiction, according to Gonzalez. The company s debtor-in-possession lenders, its financial advisers and the majority of its lawyers are based in Manhattan. Also, 11 of the company s 20 largest unsecured claims - belonging to a handful of financial institutions - emanate from New York. The judge said that, while he is ""sympathetic"" to the concerns of Enron s former employees - who have said it would be a burden for them to attend hearings outside of Texas - many of the issues concerning these workers will be addressed by congressional and federal investigations. Employees lost billions of dollars in savings when Enron s energy-trading operations collapsed after the company s debt was downgraded to junk. In the weeks leading up to the rating agencies  decisions, Enron restated more than three years of earnings and wrote down $1.2 billion in shareholder equity. The company s 401(k) plan holders, along with creditors such as former merger partner Dynegy Inc. (DYN), El Paso Merchant Energy LP and Dunhill Resources have all sought the case s transfer to Texas. When informed late Friday by Dow Jones Newswires of the judge s decision to keep the case in New York, Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said, ""... Obviously, we are supportive of the decision.""..................................................................................................................................... Ashcroft spoke to business group after Enron s Lay made request, Justice Department saysBy KAREN GULLOAssociated Press Writer01/11/2002Associated Press Newswires Copyright 2002. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. WASHINGTON (AP) - Shortly after he was confirmed as attorney general, John Ashcroft was invited by Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth Lay to speak at an exclusive meeting of corporate leaders, Justice Department officials said Friday. Lay, who was vice chairman of the Business Council, introduced Ashcroft at the Feb. 22, 2001, meeting in Washington. Ashcroft spoke about the importance of lowering crime.Government officials, including Federal Reserve members as well as Cabinet secretaries from all recent administrations, have spoken at other meetings of the Business Council, whose members are executives of the nation s largest companies. Ashcroft s speech was arranged by his schedulers and the attorney general never spoke directly to Lay, said department officials. The information was released in response to an inquiry by The Associated Press about Ashcroft s dealings with Enron since he became attorney general. Lay and Enron executives donated over $50,000 to Ashcroft s fund-raising committees in his unsuccessful campaign for Senate re-election in 2000. Ashcroft has recused himself from a Justice Department criminal investigation of the failed energy company.

Enron asked Treasury official to `call the banks  to help avoid bankruptcyBy TOM RAUMAssociated Press Writer01/11/2002Associated Press Newswires Copyright 2002. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. WASHINGTON (AP) - Enron sought the Bush administration s intervention with banks in an effort late last year to stop the company s spiral into bankruptcy, the U.S. Treasury Department disclosed Friday as the White House worked to control political fallout from a widening investigation. ""This dog won t hunt. That s a reference to the politics of it,"" said presidential spokesman Ari Fleischer amid the latest information on the collapse of the Houston-based energy conglomerate.Enron President Lawrence ""Greg"" Whalley telephoned Treasury s undersecretary for domestic finance, Peter Fisher, ""six to eight times"" in late October and early November, said department spokeswoman Michele Davis. It was the first indication that the energy trading firm, which has ties to many top Bush administration officials, had asked for government intervention as it faced collapse. Once the seventh largest U.S. company, Enron delcared bankruptcy Dec. 2. ""As Enron s negotiations with its bankers for an extension of credit neared a decision point, the president of Enron asked Undersecretary Fisher to call the banks,"" Davis said. Fisher ""inferred he was being asked to encourage the banks to extend credit. He made no such calls,"" she said. The announcement followed disclosures that Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay, one of President George W. Bush s biggest political contributors, had called Treasury Secretary Paul O Neill, Commerce Secretary Don Evans and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan in the days leading up to the biggest bankruptcy filing in U.S. history last fall. Administration officials have denied that any government aid was ever extended to the beleaguered company. Democrats, seeing the disclosures as an opportunity to chip away at Bush s high approval ratings, are emphasizing the close ties between Enron and administration officials and the impact of the failure on Enron employees. Thousands of workers were laid off and many saw their retirement nest eggs vanish when Enron stock plunged in advance of the bankruptcy filing. White House officials worked Friday to try to limit the damage, and to put distance between the president and the Enron chief. ""This needs to be fully investigated to determine if there was any criminal wrongdoing by Enron,"" said Bush press secretary Fleischer. He said the president also is pressing for a review of rules governing 401(k) retirement plans like those at Enron. ""If anybody else wants to focus on politics, that s their prerogative. But the president s focus is on getting to the bottom of this fully,"" Fleischer said aboard Air Force One on a presidential trip to Pennsylvania. Meanwhile, senior Bush adviser Karl Rove offered his view of the relationship between Bush and Lay. ""The president knows him. He is a friend. But the idea that he is a friend in the sense that this is a guy who s a close intimate is just ludicrous,"" Rove said in an interview with The Associated Press. When Bush was the governor of Texas, Lay was chairman of the governor s business council. ""They had quarterly meetings and he d come in and talk to the then-governor about what it was they hoped to achieve at the meeting and they d go over the agenda,"" Rove said. Bush has described Lay as ""a supporter."" He said he saw Lay twice last year, but that they did not discuss Enron s finances......................................................................................................................................

Congress Demands Documents From Enron, Andersen (Update2)2002-01-11 18:10 (New York)Congress Demands Documents From Enron, Andersen (Update2)     (Adds Fisher s lack of holdings in 12th paragraphs.)     Washington, Jan. 11 (Bloomberg) -- Congress demandeddocuments and personal files from executives at Enron Corp.,auditor Arthur Andersen LLP and 49 current and former officers anddirectors in an effort to find out what led to the biggest U.S.bankruptcy.     The House Energy and Commerce Committee asked for thepersonal files of David Duncan and five other Andersen partnersinvolved in the audit of Enron, after Andersen said its employeeshad destroyed documents and e-mails, committee spokesman KenJohnson said. The Senate s Permanent Subcommittee onInvestigations subpoenaed papers from both Enron, once the biggestenergy trader, and Andersen.      Congress acted a day after President George W. Bush sadministration said Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay, a long-timepolitical backer of the president, had unsuccessfully soughtgovernment help for Enron from Commerce Secretary Don Evans andTreasury Secretary Paul O Neill. Today Treasury disclosed thatEnron President Greg Whalley called Undersecretary Peter Fisher atleast six times in October and early November to ask him tocontact bankers on behalf of the company.     ``This debacle is so massive, it requires speed andthoroughness,   said Senator Carl Levin, the Michigan Democrat whois chairman of the Subcommittee on Investigations. ``The subpoenasare necessary in order to get prompt and thorough review of thedocuments in question.       Levin said the subpoenas were changed at the last minuteyesterday to request information on Andersen s destruction ofdocuments, a development he said was ``very troubling.   Responsesto the subpoenas are due Jan. 31, Levin said.                         $26 Billion Loss     Enron said Nov. 8 that it had inflated earnings by $586million over four years. The company filed for bankruptcyprotection Dec. 2 after a seven-week stock slide that erased $26billion in value. Employees who were unable to sell Enron stock intheir retirement plans say they lost about $850 million.     At least six congressional committees are investigatingEnron s collapse. Committee leaders say they need to understandexactly what happened at Enron to determine whether new laws andregulations are needed to improve disclosure, change accountingpractices or protect employee retirement accounts.                        Contacts Disclosed     After declining to comment in detail on Enron s bankruptcyfor several weeks, yesterday the administration said Lay calledEvans on Oct. 29 and asked him to intervene with Moody s InvestorsService to prevent a downgrade of Enron s debt, Commerce spokesmanJim Dyke said.     ``Evans decided that taking any action would beinappropriate,   Dyke said. ``There was no information exchangedbetween Mr. Lay and Secretary Evans that was not part of thepublic domain.       Lay also spoke with O Neill about how a collapse of Enronmight hurt financial markets, Treasury spokeswoman Michelle Davissaid yesterday. O Neill also decided to take no action.     When Whalley called Fisher, ``Undersecretary Fisher inferredhe was being asked to encourage banks to extend credit,   Davissaid. ``He made no such calls.       Treasury said that while a trust in his parents name includedEnron shares, Fisher ``does not now and never has held commonstock in Enron.       Evans and O Neill didn t tell Bush about the calls untilyesterday, White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said. Bush said hehasn t spoken to Lay in more than six months.                      Campaign Contributions     Lay raised more than $100,000 for Bush s presidentialcampaign and let Bush aides use Enron s corporate jet on at least30 occasions. Enron and its employees together were Bush s 12th-largest backer for the election, giving $113,800. Enron and itsemployees gave Democrat Al Gore $11,250.     Representative Henry Waxman of California, the seniorDemocrat on the House Government Reform Committee, today sentletters to O Neill and Evans, requesting details on all contactsbetween Enron and officials at Treasury and Commerce. He alsowants to know what the two departments told the White House.     ``The purpose of this request is to determine why theadministration apparently did nothing to mitigate the harm of theEnron bankruptcy to thousands of its employees and shareholders,  Waxman wrote.                         Senate Subpoenas     The documents sought by the Senate include working papers andnotes from the auditors, memorandums from executives putting intoplace internal controls, and memos outlining and describingfinancing vehicles used for off-balance-sheet financing and othertransactions.     Lay, who got $101 million from the sale of his Enron shares,according to plaintiff s attorneys representing shareholders, isamong those receiving subpoenas from the Senate committee.     Jeffrey Skilling, the former chief executive officer whoresigned on Aug. 14, is also subpoenaed, along with former ChiefFinancial Officer Andrew Fastow.     Members of the board of directors also were receivingsubpoenas, including former Commodities Futures Trading CommissionChairwoman Wendy Gramm, the wife of Senator Phil Gramm, a TexasRepublican, and a member of Enron s audit committee.                       Partnerships Targeted     The Senate subcommittee is targeting ``offshore entities,special-purpose entities and limited partnerships that Enronused,   Levin said. It is asking whether the financing techniquesEnron used should have raised flags for Enron s board andAndersen.     SEC Enforcement Director Stephen Cutler said yesterday theSEC will add Andersen s document destruction to the Enron-relatedmatters it is investigating.     ``Destruction of documents is obviously an extremely seriousmatter,   Cutler said.     Lawyers representing investors in lawsuits against Enron arewatching the subcommittee because it is likely to obtaininformation sooner than will the civil courts.     Most of the shareholder lawsuits were filed in federal courtin Houston and won t move to the discovery phase, in which lawyersmay interrogate defendants and demand documents, for six months.     ``Skilling was clearly moving the company from an asset-basedmodel to a pure trading machine,   said Patrick Daniels, a lawyerat Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach. ``You would hope someoneinside Enron was doing some analysis of how these deals wouldbenefit Enron.

Enron Probe Overseen by Former Senate Counsel2002-01-11 17:51 (New York)Justice Dept. Enron Probe Overseen by Former Senate Counsel     Washington, Jan. 11 (Bloomberg) -- The U.S. JusticeDepartment probe of Enron Corp. will be overseen by a lawyer withmore than 20 years of prosecution experience, including runningthe U.S. Senate s investigation into the Whitewater scandal.     Michael Chertoff, the head of the department s criminaldivision, was Republican counsel to the special committee thatinvestigated the involvement of former President Bill Clinton andhis wife in the failed Whitewater real-estate development.     The Justice Department s investigation into the collapse ofthe world s largest energy trader will be led by Joshua Hochberg,the head of the department s fraud section since December 1998.Hochberg will be the acting U.S. attorney for the case.     ``Hochberg will be the day-to-day supervisor. Chertoff wouldbe involved in big decisions -- decisions to indict or make a dealwith low-level employees,   said Gregory Wallance, a formerfederal prosecutor.     U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft won t be involved in theinvestigation, having announced yesterday his recusal from Enronmatters. The Houston-based company was a major contributor to his2000 Senate campaign.     Next in line is Deputy Attorney General Larry Thompson, whois expected to have little involvement in the investigation, legalexperts say.                            Task Force     The Justice Department is establishing an Enron task force,to be headed by Leslie Caldwell, the chief of the criminaldivision for the U.S. attorney s office in San Francisco.Caldwell, who has prosecuted organized crime and while collarcrime, will report to Hochberg.     Enron announced Nov. 8 that it had inflated earnings by $585million over four years. On Dec. 2, it filed the biggest U.S.bankruptcy after a seven-week stock slide that erased $26 billionin market value, wiped out 5,000 jobs and cost employees about$850 million in retirement savings.     During that period, employees were unable to sell Enron stockin their 401(k) plans. Top executives who had large holdingsoutside of the retirement plan were able to sell.     The investigation will likely concentrate on whetherexecutives purposely misled investors about Enron s financialcondition to prove criminal wrongdoing, experts say.     Deliberate misrepresentation of a company s financialcondition transforms what is usually a civil violation of federaldisclosure rules into a crime punishable by as much as 10 years inprison and a $1 million fine.                    `Best and Brightest      The investigation will be based in Washington and includelawyers from the criminal division, including the fraud section,and from U.S. attorneys  offices throughout the country. Lawyersfrom the New York and San Francisco offices, which specialize insecurities law and white collar crime, are expected to beinvolved, a Justice Department official said.     ``We re bringing in our best and brightest,   said JusticeDepartment spokesman Bryan Sierra. ``You go where they are knownfor this type of investigations.       The decision to centralize the investigation makes sensebecause ``there s an enormous amount of legwork that goes into acase like this,   said Wallance. ``It s inefficient to duplicateefforts.       A grand jury is either already in the works or about to beimpaneled, experts say. Investigators will be culling throughdocuments, computer records, bank records and conducting scores ofinterviews, experts say.     ``They will be looking at what was being said, to whom it wasbeing said and why it was being said,   said Joe Whitley, a formeracting associate attorney general.     Document destruction by Arthur Andersen LLP, Enron s auditor,will also be examined to determine if the firm can be charged withobstruction of justice, Whitley said.                    Recusals, Recusals     Ashcroft s announcement that he wouldn t participate in theEnron probe followed a call to step aside by U.S. RepresentativeHenry Waxman, a California Democrat, who cited about $55,000 thatEnron and its Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay made topolitical groups aiding Ashcroft s unsuccessful re-election bid.     When Ashcroft recused himself from the investigation, he wasunaware of the letter sent to his office by Waxman, a JusticeDepartment official said.     The U.S. attorney s office in Houston also recused itselffrom the investigation because of the ``fact that a number ofattorneys in the office, including the U.S. attorney, have familyrelationships with individuals who are arguably affected by theEnron bankruptcy,   according to a statement released by U.S.Attorney Michael Shelby.     The Justice Department said it hasn t determined yet how itwill conduct the investigation in Houston, though it may useFederal Bureau of Investigation facilities there.                           Men in Charge     In addition to the Enron probe, Chertoff is also running theinvestigation into the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.     A Harvard Law School graduate, Chertoff was U.S. attorney inNew Jersey between 1990 and 1994.

The decision is a defeat for Dynegy Inc. and other Enroncreditors who had asked U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Arthur J. Gonzalezto move the case to Houston. Enron and Dynegy, rival energytraders, are both based there.     Gonzalez also denied Dynegy s request to transfer a $10billion lawsuit Enron brought against Dynegy for backing out of amerger that was supposed to rescue Enron.     Enron s Chapter 11 case and the lawsuit were filed Dec. 2 inManhattan, where a small unit, Enron Metals and Commodity Corp.,is based.     Dynegy argued in court papers that both cases should beshifted to Houston ``in the interest of justice and for theconvenience of the parties.       Enron, once a dominant force in the energy trading business,collapsed after announcing on Nov. 8 that it inflated earnings by$586 million over four years. The disclosure triggered a loss ofconfidence among investors and customers and the cancellation of aplanned $23 billion merger with Dynegy.     The effort to move the case to Houston divided Enron screditors. Some banks, including several based in New York and ledby J.P.

That partnership,called Chewco Investments LP, was kept off Enron s books, enablingthe energy trader to inflate earnings by $400 million starting in1997.     Andersen s accounting of Enron is under investigation by theJustice Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission andCongress. Andersen said yesterday that some of its employeesdestroyed a substantial number of documents related to its Enronaudit.     Berardino learned of the correct information earlier thisweek when a news reporter called with an inquiry and Andersenlooked up the answer, Tabolt said. The mistake was inconsequentialbecause it would have had no effect on how Andersen handled itsEnron audits or on the substance of Berardino s testimony, hesaid.     Berardino told the House Financial Services Committee on Dec.12 that Andersen informed Enron s audit committee ``of possibleillegal acts within the company   involving Chewco.

We met with Bryan Murtagh (UBS attorney) and did an overview of the contract services we are looking to set up with the pipes, how those are utilized and some of the underlying risks/exposure of using these contracts. Basically the message was these are non-negotiable contracts, he seemed to understand that and didn t indicate this would require any major legal review from their side. We also had a discussion about the credit requirements and what some of the pipes are asking for. Follow up credit meeting to take place today to get into some greater detail and get a standard credit package together. Also UBS did indicate that they also want to do a credit review of the pipes before moving forward. To faciltiate that we gave them a list of the Day 1 pipes to start their process.In summary, I don t believe there will be any challenge on us entering into these agreements nor a lenghty review by the UBS attorneys. The credit issue is big, need to have them expedite their review of pipelines and also recognize our need to satisfy the pipeline credit requirments for a new customer (standard credit package and any addtional requirements). Also need some defintitive answers on when we can actually send this information out (is it now or is it when the deal closes). Suzanne is going to a legal meeting this AM to discuss/recap where everything is at this point in time. I will forward any additonal information to you when I get it. This assumes the Power of Attorney issue will be settled shortly for contract execution.Bob   -----Original Message-----From: 	Shively, Hunter S.

It is planned to include all  traders, originators, mid/back-office staff and IT teams who would normally be involved with electronic trading.Purpose of the simulation - The simulation will test our ""live"" trading environment (restricted to internal access only) and will:Test the integrity and functionality of the system and related processes (including credit, risk, legal, operations, etc.)Provide an opportunity for traders to verify their products and product setupDemonstrate how the trading system and processes work to UBS staff visiting next weekNature of the simulation - The simulation will include testing of all processes related to trading and mid/back-office functions:Credit, Legal, Risk, Operations, and other groups:Profile tests for ""external"" customers (role-played by Originators)Profile tests for internal users (traders, back-office, etc.)Data and Process checking as completed transactions flow through Mid/back-Office systemsTraders and Originators:Traders will be managing their individual books and associated products. Although we may be restricted to certain financial products on launch day, both physical and financial will be available during the simulation. Each trader will be asked to manage their individual position and profitability goals for the simulation.Originators and others will be asked to play the roles of counterparties. Credit limits, etc. will be tested during the simulation.Information Technology:Will assist in preparing data on the system for the simulation.After the simulation is over, will work with the relevant groups to test the trade-data in various systems and risk booksWill ensure all simulation data is removed from the system after the simulation is complete.Next steps Traders and Originators will be contacted prior to simulation day to ensure they have appropriate access to the system.Originators will be assigned specific roles. You should expect to receive an email and/or handout on or before Wednesday, Feb. 6.UBSWenergy personnel will be meeting with back office personnel over the next several days to ensure everything is in place for the simulation.SummaryThis simulation is an important step towards re-launching our trading business. We appreciate the participation of everyone involved as we prepare for the public launch of UBS Warburg Energy and the UBSWenergy trading platform.If you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or ideas regarding this simulation, please feel free to contact Bob Shults (30397) or myself (31861).

The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.	(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen 	First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)(iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate	We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.	I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.(iv)	Due Diligence	We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.Happy New YearLouise"

This pushes the cost of content for NewCo to over $360,000 for relatively little benefit.Therefore, contrary to what we agreed earlier, I would like to drop all of the content on the right side of the quotes screen.

295961,2002-02-05 16:22:10,"It was just brought to my attention by Dave Steiner that the Estate will continue to own the F(urniture), F(ixtures), and E(quipment) and that UBS will be able to use it for free so long as we are in this building.As you both know, it is possible that we will move from this floor and would like to take a good portion of the FFE with us.  My understanding is that Enron is leasing the furniture in Houston and owns the furniture in Portland.  Therefore, it makes sense for the Houston office to continue to use the furniture but not move it.  It doesn t make as much sense here as it will be expensive for the Estate to dispose of the furniture here and it will be even more expensive to move it to sell it.Here s the issue -- the Estate should convey the furniture in Portland to UBS.  Is this possible?  What do we need to do to make this happen?"

295974,2002-02-06 07:22:03,"Louise -- The Houston legal/regulatory group is working with the UBS legal department to obtain from the London branch of UBS AG a power of attorney which will expedite the execution of agreements and other signature documents involved in starting the energy trading activities. (I will provide you specific information on the nature of this power of attorney as soon as I obtain it.)  To get this in place as soon as possible, we ve been asked to provide backup information with sufficient specificity that the nature of each relationship/contract and counterparty is identified.  (Example 1: ""Wholesale power trading master purchase and sale agreement with Duke Energy Trading and Marketing L.L.C. and related transaction confirmations"".   Example 2: We would specify the contract and counterparty for each of the 44 gas pipelines which we need to utilize for gas trading operations in ERCOT).  Accordingly, we will need to get (from Dave Forster?) the names of the priority counterparties, correlated with the list of the agreements we are seeking to complete with each.  I think it would be best if we were also provided such information on other, lower priority, tiers of counterparties, if they have been identified, with whom we seek trading relationships but which were not included in the first priority group who were sent materials.  That way, if lower priority counterparties surface and want to complete trading relationship documents with us, they will be covered by such power of attorney.  I am going to contact Dave Forster this morning to discuss this further.  I am also going to discuss this matter with LLoyd Will, who may be aware of other relationships/agreements pertinent to the start-up of trading operations, say, research oriented relationships involving data feed relationships, software licenses, etc.  Jim Steffes last night started his group working on this from the standpoint of contracts, registrations, applications, licenses and other regulatory requirements he has identified for the UBS start.   Please contact me with any questions. --David Portz"
295996,2002-02-06 13:52:03,"Further to our call this morning, I want to outline the attached list of outstanding matters respecting the Canadian business, which may not be exhaustive.  Further, at the outset and to manage expectations, I want to emphasize that the preparation of the Canadian business for commercial start-up needs to be considered within the framework of human resource constraints, attending to finalization of acquisition agreements and arrangements with Enron Canada for the acquisition of the Canadian business interest, and as yet unclear understanding with respect to various matters of detail that are required with respect to the commencement of the Canadian business within UBSW.  At the same time, I understand that there is an extraordinary amount of work that needs to be done to address the U.S. side of the North American power business and that the detail required to be considered with respect to the Canadian gas and power business may have to take a back seat to those matters for the time being.  With that, the following is my list of issues that need to be considered:1.	Trading Forms:	(a)	Gas GTC - I have circulated my blackline comments to the form prepared in Houston, noting certain of my comments are jurisdictional to Canada but others are generic to the form in general.  The blackline is attached:	 		(b)	Financial GTC - Again, I have circulated my blackline comments to the form prepared in Houston, noting certain of my comments are jurisdictional to Canada and others are more generic to the form in general.  The blackline is attached:	 	(c)	Power GTC - I have not yet had the opportunity to review or consider the proposed forms prepared in Houston; and	(d)	Master Agreements (gas, power and financial) -  I have not yet had the opportunity to review or consider the proposed forms prepared in Houston.  Subject to the other matters referred to below, the priority for first trading in our market is finalizing the Gas GTC and the Financial GTC.2.	Guarantees:  I attach a blacklined revision to the UBS AG form as revised by Carol, with my revisions reflecting comments to the form as commented on by Carol:	 Structurally, I have the following concerns:	(a)	I believe we should consider a more flexible description of all potential gas, power and financial transactions in the recitals to the guarantee to facilitate a broadbased guarantee from the counterparty;	(b)	I do not believe that the guarantee should be limited to an aggregate financial limit.  This requires credit monitoring, and in my experience can result in the risk of under-guaranteed amounts with the counterparty.  Further, where UBS AG has a direct covenant, it seems to me that there would be no corresponding limit on its exposure;	(c)	I have other comments, some of which again are jurisdictional to Canada and others of which are more generic to the form in general;	(d)	as I have mentioned, we need to have an approved form of guarantee to be provided from UBS AG in support of UBS Warburg Energy (Canada) Ltd. (""UBSWC""), which I assume will be in the same form merely reversed to be in favour of the trading counterparty.  We will also need to understand the specific internal process we must follow to obtain the UBS AG guarantee of UBS Warburg Energy (Canada) Ltd.;	(e)	where UBS AG is providing guarantee support for UBSWC, we expect that some market participants or institutions will require guarantee support in forms which are  different from UBS AG s customary guarantee form.  In other words, various market participants such as transportation providers (NOVA, TCPL, Westcoast, Foothills, ANG, etc.), transmission administrators (EAL, IMO), gas inventory administrators (NOVA), gas storage providers, exchange operators (Natural Gas Exchange, Intercontinental Exchange, WattExchange), power pool administrators (PPoA, IMO), etc., some of which are regulated and others of which only deal on their own terms, may require guarantee support in their own forms.  Again, in these instances we will have to understand the specific internal process through which we can obtain the customized guarantee from UBS AG; and	(f)	we need to resolve the mechanism for providing a UBS AG guarantee for online trades entered into prior to negotiating a fully guaranteed Master Agreement.3.	Transaction Procedures:  With respect to UBSWC, we need to understand the following:	(a)	for trading counterparties, we need a detailed understanding of the proposed execution, guarantee and daily novation procedures back to the London branch;	(b)	who will be the authorized signing officers and what will be the execution procedures for UBSWC for GTCs, Masters, Confirms, etc.?;	(c)	for non-trading/market participation counterparties (i.e., transportation providers, transmission administrators, gas inventory providers, gas storage providers, exchange operators, power pool administrators, etc.), are the same transaction procedures intended (i.e., is UBSWC the executing counterparty, guaranteed by UBS AG, and do the novation procedures back to the London branch apply?); 	(d)	are the trading confirms being updated?; and	(e)	is consideration being given to procedures whereby trading confirms can be eliminated (i.e., the volume of confirms for Enron Online had become somewhat overwhelming for the Operations Group and they have indicated to me that there are proposals to remove the need for trading confirms, at least for online transactions)?4.	Regulatory/Market Participation:  	(a)	I understand that Rob Hemstock has provided detailed documentation with respect to the permitting/market participation requirements and has partially drafted the required forms.  Finalizing most of these applications  requires some of the more detailed understandings I have referred to above;	(b)	I have not been involved in the creation of UBSWC, which I understand has been done by Stikeman Elliott, but we need to ensure that it is corporately registered to carry on business as an extra-provincial corporation in all key jurisdictions (Alberta, Ontario and British Columbia); and	(c)	We will require for various purposes, including obtaining regulatory and permitting approvals and authorizations, copies of the incorporation and organization documentation for UBSWC, including list of directors and officers;	(d)	In some instances (e.g. NEB gas and power export permits) the Canadian permit will be held by UBS Warburg Energy Ltd. and therefore we need copies of the incorporation and organization documentation for UBS Warburg Energy Ltd.   We will also need to ensure UBS Warburg Energy Ltd. it is corporately registered to carry on business in Canada and that we are provided with Canadian organization documentation for UBS Warburg Energy Ltd. that we can use to satisfy the NEB of its corporate status."

Proceeds from the notes were to be used to acquire theTrusts  initial investments, and buyers are to be paid interestfrom the proceeds of those certain assets, according to anoffering memorandum. The Trusts can invest in securities withshort-term ratings of at least ``A1   from S&P and ``P1   fromMoody s Investors Service, as long as they mature before thematurity dates of the notes.     There are four notes, each divided into two offerings, someoffered publicly and some privately sold. All the notes arescheduled to mature in August 2005 or May 2006 and were sold by agroup of banks led by Salomon Smith Barney, a unit of Citigroup.     In the event of an Enron credit event, Citibank, which actedas a swap counter-party to the trusts, can take the trusts investments in return for Enron debt obligations. The Enron debtis then liquidated by the trust, with the proceeds paid to theinvestors.     Neither Enron nor Citibank have direct obligations to theholders of the notes, according to an offering memorandum.

DOES NOT GUARANTEE THE ACCURACY OF THISTRANSCRIPT.     New York, Nov. 7 (Bloomberg) -- The following is atranscript of a Bloomberg interview with Former Securitiesand Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Arthur Levitt.  Thereporter is Dylan Ratigan.     RATIGAN:  As you ve probably heard, Enron underinvestigation by the SEC, the SEC looking into partnershipsrun by their former CFO.  If you come into the Bloombergwith me, I want to show you what it s done to the stockprice here over the course of the past month, month and ahalf.  You re talking about a move from a price in the mid40s, which was not that long ago, mind you, early mid-October, to a price that is now $9.67 a share.  This hasabsolutely decimated the company s stock price.  ArthurLevitt, the former chairman of the SEC, with us, looking,first of all, at what s going on with this company.     But, before I do that, let me say good morning to you.     LEVITT:  Good morning, Dylan.     RATIGAN:  Talk to me.     LEVITT:  You know, there are certain warning signs herethat investors have to be careful of:  related partytransactions.  Anytime you see a related party transaction,an investor should be very careful.  What they were doing,was they were simply setting up these partnerships to moveoff the balance sheet acquisitions and borrowings that wouldreally have hurt the balance sheet and I think giveninvestors a very different picture.     RATIGAN:  Well, let s just make it real clear topeople, because they can easily get confused.  I m acompany.     LEVITT:  Yes.     RATIGAN:  .and I create - and I m an executive of thatcompany, and I create a partnership that has nothing to dowith that company, legally, on paper.     LEVITT:  But all the risks and rewards still belong tothe parent company.  The affect of this is the subsidiaryborrows the money to make the acquisition from anotherpartnership set up by the parent. This stays totally off thebalance sheet of the parent company.  Why does this happen?     RATIGAN:  So, in other words, Company ABC exists, theyset up Subsidiary 123.     LEVITT:  Yes.     RATIGAN:  Subsidiary company 123 borrows money from.     LEVITT:  To make an acquisition.     RATIGAN:  A bank?     LEVITT:  No.     RATIGAN:  They borrow money from who?     LEVITT:  They issue bonds.     RATIGAN:  OK.  They borrow money from the world.     LEVITT:  Yes.     RATIGAN:  . whoever wants to lend them money.     LEVITT:  Yes.     RATIGAN:  . they borrow money, they make anacquisition.  Now Subsidiary 123 down here has big debtsthat don t reflect upstairs on Company ABC?     LEVITT:  Precisely.     RATIGAN:  But ABC still gets to use the asset that wasbought by 123?     LEVITT:  Yes.     RATIGAN:  OK.     LEVITT:  Exactly.  Now, how does it happen?  Theaccounting firm that handled this transaction, ArthurAndersen, received $25 million for an audit of the company -that s a huge amount - and $27 million for consultingservices - another danger sign.  A lot of dough.  Thoseconsulting services were to validate these transactions; $52million dollars went to the accountants.  The problem hereis an audit committee was not doing its work.  If you lookat Enron s statements - and how many times have we heardthey were confusing?  It s the job of the auditing firm tosee to it that it is not confusing.  That s the realproblem.  Now, what can you do about it?     RATIGAN:  Tell me.     LEVITT:  I think, actually, the FASB, the independentstandards setter, could put through a rule, which says.     RATIGAN:  And FASB is the Federal Accounting StandardsBoard.  They set the rules.     LEVITT:  Yes.  Located in Norwalk, Connecticut.  Theycould say, if a company sets up another legal entity, andthe company retains all the risks and rewards of thatentity, then the public company, that public company thatset up these entities, must consolidate in the P&L, in thebalance sheet, all of these transactions.     Now, how does that come about?  I think the SEC couldurge the FASB to do this.  In 1990, the present chiefaccountant of the SEC called for that action to be takenplace, but at that point, the then-chief accountant didn tsupport the move.     RATIGAN:  And this creates, in your mind, a rallyingcall to reiterate that request with more venom and morepassion than before?     LEVITT:  I don t know about venom, but I.     RATIGAN:  But with passion.     LEVITT:  I certainly think that passion - I think thisis clearly a call for better disclosure.     RATIGAN:  Fair enough.  I will see you next week, OK?     LEVITT:  Good.  Nice to see you.     RATIGAN:  You, too.     ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***USA: U.S. FERC watching Enron s impact on energy markets.11/07/2001Reuters English News Service(C) Reuters Limited 2001.WASHINGTON, Nov 7 (Reuters) - The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is w=atching what effect Enron Corp. s financial problems may have on interstate= electricity and natural gas markets, FERC chairman Pat Wood said on Wednes=day.=20However, Wood said FERC does not have a direct role in the ongoing federal =investigation of the company.""We re watching the impact that Enron or any other firm would have on the o=verall workings of the market, but we re not intervening where other agenci=es have jurisdiction,"" Wood told reporters during a briefing after the agen=cy s regular meeting.=20Enron, the nation s largest trader of natural gas and electricity, is under= attack for failing to explain off-balance sheet transactions that led to a= $1.2 billion write-down of shareholder equity.=20The deals, conducted with partnerships run by ousted Chief Financial Office=r Andrew Fastow, are under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchang=e Commission.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The complaint was broug=ht against defendants Enron, Kenneth Lay, Jeffrey K. Skilling and Andrew Fa=stow. The case is numbered H-01-3736. The Honorable Melinda Harmon is the J=udge presiding over the case.=20The Complaint alleges that defendants violated Section 10(b) and 20(a) of t=he Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 by issuing a series of material misr=epresentations to the market between January 18, 2000 and October 17, 2001,= thereby artificially inflating the price of Enron common stock.

Subsequently, Enron revealed that a material portion of t=he charge was related to the unwinding of investments with certain limited =partnerships which were controlled by Enron s chief financial officer and t=hat the Company would be eliminating more than $1 billion in shareholder eq=uity as a result of its unwinding of the investments.

Emshwiller and Rebecca Smith in Los Angeles and Robin Sidel and Jonathan Weil in New York11/09/2001The Wall Street JournalA3(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)Enron Corp. reduced its previously reported net income dating back to 1997 by $586 million, or 20%, mostly due to improperly accounting for its dealings with partnerships run by some company officers. The disclosure, contained in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, came even as the Houston energy-trading company continued its merger talks with rival Dynegy Inc. Dynegy, an independent power producer and utility owner, is looking at acquiring Enron for roughly $7 billion to $8 billion, people familiar with the talks say. However, those talks could also be influenced by whether Enron is further downgraded by major credit-ratings agencies.The total price being discussed would equate to about $10 an Enron share, barely above where the stock is currently trading and far below the level of even two weeks ago. As of 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Enron shares were down 7.1%, or 64 cents, to $8.41, a tenth of their 52-week high of $84.875. On the Big Board, Dynegy traded at $36.50, up $3.50. Shares of several energy-trading companies were up yesterday following a directive from federal regulators that the California state government pay an estimated $1.6 billion for past power purchases. In yesterday s SEC filing, Enron also made major adjustments in its reported assets, debt and shareholder equity back to 1997. For instance, for the three-month period ended Sept. 30, Enron lopped about $2.2 billion, or 19%, off shareholder equity, reducing it to a total of $9.5 billion. Previously, the company had disclosed a reduction of only $1.2 billion. The filing also said that Enron discharged Ben Glisan, the company treasurer, and Kristina Mordaunt, the general counsel of Enron s North America unit, in connection with investments they made in one of the officer-run limited partnerships. Until yesterday, Enron had insisted that Mr. Glisan wasn t associated with the officer-run partnerships. The company wouldn t explain why the the two had been discharged, and Mr. Glisan and Ms. Mordaunt couldn t be reached to comment. The SEC filing is the latest chapter in a crisis that has engulfed the nation s biggest energy-trading company during the past month. During that time, Enron has reported a big third-quarter loss, the replacement of its chief financial officer who ran two of the controversial partnerships, and an SEC investigation. The SEC filing raises further questions about Enron s accounting procedures and disclosure policies. Concerns over these matters are vexing investors and analysts, including those at major credit-rating agencies. The agencies downgraded Enron debt during recent weeks and have the company on review for further downgrades. Ralph Pellecchia, credit analyst for Fitch, said he couldn t predict what effect the SEC filing would have on Enron s credit rating, but he added that the document contained damaging disclosures. ""It s bad,"" he said. The Enron SEC filing also raises questions about the conduct of its outside auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, which reviewed the company s annual financial statements and certified them as consistent with accepted accounting principals. Because of all the accounting adjustments ""the audit reports covering the year-end financial statements for 1997-2000 should not be relied upon,"" yesterday s SEC filing said. An Andersen spokesman called Enron s restatement announcement ""an unfortunate situation"" but said the accounting firm is ""cooperating with the company . . . to bring resolution to these matters."" He said he couldn t comment further because of client-confidentiality concerns. Among the accounting turnabouts, Enron said it had improperly accounted for two partnerships connected to Michael Kopper, a former managing director of the company s North America unit. The two partnerships were known as Joint Energy Development Investments LP, or JEDI, and Chewco Investments LP. As reported, Mr. Kopper managed the general partner of Chewco, which was formed in 1997. JEDI had been formed in 1993 by Enron in partnership with the huge California Public Employees  Retirement System, or Calpers. In 1997 Enron, which operated JEDI, bought out Calpers  interest for $383 million and immediately sold it to Chewco, according to the SEC filing. Almost all the money for Chewco s purchase came in loans from JEDI and an unnamed financial institution, whose loan was guaranteed by Enron. By having a supposed outside party in the form of Chewco as a partner, Enron treated JEDI as an unconsolidated affiliate and kept hundreds of millions of dollars of partnership debt off its balance sheet. Enron now acknowledges that treatment was wrong and that both JEDI and Chewco should have been consolidated starting in 1997. Taking that step retroactively resulted in a $396 million reduction in net income for the years 1997 to 2000, the SEC filing said. Mr. Kopper, who left Enron in July to run the partnerships, didn t return a phone call seeking comment. In the past, he has declined to be interviewed. Enron also retroactively consolidated some of the results of its dealings with a partnership called LJM Cayman LP. That consolidation reduced 1999 and 2000 net income by $103 million. LJM and a similar but much larger partnership, called LJM2 Co-Investment LP, were formed in 1999 by Enron s then-chief financial officer Andrew Fastow, who was replaced last month. The two partnerships were run by Mr. Fastow and Mr. Kopper, according to the Enron SEC filing and private partnership documents. Enron s SEC filing said the company believes that Mr. Fastow sold his interests in the LJM partnerships in July to Mr. Kopper. Mr. Fastow has declined to be interviewed. Several analysts said they were troubled that none of the earnings restatements were directly attributed to the much larger LJM2 partnership. Some also pointed to a sentence in the SEC filing that said ""it is possible"" that continuing Enron reviews will ""identify additional or different information concerning these matters."" As such, ""there remains doubt about whether there is something else in the closet,"" said Brian Youngberg, energy analyst at Edward Jones in St. Louis. The Enron SEC filing gave new information about the effect on company earnings of transactions related to the LJM partnerships. Since 1999, those transactions produced $577.8 million in pretax earnings, despite a $711 million pretax charge in this year s third quarter due to the termination of deals with several LJM2-related entities. The filing also estimated that Mr. Fastow received more than $30 million from the LJM partnerships. --- Mea CulpaIn the midst of talks to be acquired by Dynegy, Enron detailsaccounting and other actions.-- Will restate its financial results from 1997 through the thirdquarter of 2001, reducing previously reported income by $586 millionand boosting previously reported debt to $628 million at the end of2000-- Concedes three entities run by company officials should have beenincluded in its consolidated financial statements, based on generallyaccepted accounting principles-- Fires Ben Glisan, managing director and treasurer, and KristinaMordaunt, managing director and general counsel of an Enron division-- Establishes a special committee to review all transactionsSource: the companyCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

It Doesn t Act Like ItBy FLOYD NORRIS11/09/2001The New York TimesPage 1, Column 2c. 2001 New York Times CompanyYOU D be better informed if, instead of listening to what we say, you watch what we do.   That excellent advice was not issued by Enron management, although it should have been. Instead it came more than 30 years ago from John N. Mitchell, President Richard M. Nixon s attorney general.Enron s restatement of earnings yesterday did not go far enough to allow investors to understand all of what went on during the company s many strange transactions with related parties. It is now consolidating the results of some of its off-balance-sheet creations, though what happened in the most important ones remains a mystery. But the restatement should, at the least, cause investors and Wall Street analysts to realize they have been fooled by so-called pro forma earnings, which leave out unpleasant realities and ignore accounting rules. In January, Enron told investors its   recurring net income,   as it calls its pro forma number, would be $1.70 to $1.75 a share this year. The company s share price rose to $82 when that forecast was made. Remarkably, Enron is still on course to hit that target. Yesterday s restatement raised its nine-month earnings figure by a penny, to $1.36. And yet Enron appears to be willing to sell out for about $10 a share, or less than six times its reported profits, which still appear to be growing. Why so little? The answer may be that Enron s board knows those numbers are not reliable measures of performance. Enron s failure to disclose more about the still unconsolidated subsidiaries is an indication that the unreleased facts would not be reassuring. And Enron cannot stay in business unless customers and investors believe it is financially solid. So it is willing to sell out for a fraction of what it appeared to be worth only weeks ago. Don t call it a takeover. Takeunder would be a better term. What set off Enron s collapse? It now appears to have been a mistake. Enron says it added $1 billion to shareholder equity in 2000 and early this year in error. The mistake did nothing to improve Enron s profits at the time, so it seems unlikely it was deliberate. Had the mistake not been made, the reduction in shareholder equity it disclosed last month would have been $200 million, not $1.2 billion. That reduction scared investors into believing that Enron s transactions with partnerships led by Andrew Fastow, its former chief financial officer, had been disastrous for the company. Now it appears they may not have been so bad. But that fact is not very important now. Enron s new disclosures indicate that perhaps 40 percent of its reported profits in 2000 came from dealings with the Fastow partnerships. Such profits may be legal under accounting rules, but there are good reasons to doubt how real they are. In fact, the accounting rule makers are even now pondering a question that may be important to Enron. The body charged with dealing with new accounting issues got a rush question on Oct. 23 -- the day before Enron ousted Mr. Fastow -- about the accounting on transactions at a hypothetical   Big Energy Corporation   where one subsidiary, a natural gas pipeline company, trades with another subsidiary, an energy trading entity. The question posed was whether a company can report profits made by one subsidiary while ignoring the losses of the other one. That company may or may not be Enron. Such games will not work anymore, at least for Enron. It needs to be acquired because its customers are not willing to believe even its revised numbers.Graph shows Enron share prices since Oct. 15.

Business/Financial Desk; Section CSurest Steps, Not the Swiftest, Are Propelling Dynegy Past EnronBy NEELA BANERJEE11/09/2001The New York TimesPage 5, Column 1c. 2001 New York Times CompanyThe tortoise appears ready to overtake the hare. Until they confirmed yesterday that they were in merger talks, the Enron Corporation and Dynegy Inc. were rivals within the new, rapidly evolving deregulated power industry. Each embodied a sharply different approach to making money, attracting investors and winning over regulators.Enron thrived on risk, hurling itself into projects and businesses largely untested by others, earning along the way a reputation for innovation and the acclaim of the investors and analysts who now so angrily shun it because of its murky accounting. Dynegy is the slower, more cautious company, the younger sibling that carefully gleaned lessons from the example set by a brasher Enron. Dynegy s steady progress has now made it strong and solvent enough to contemplate a multibillion-dollar takeover of its erstwhile competitor. As one senior energy industry executive said,   Enron s trying to hit more triples and home runs, while Dynegy tries for singles and doubles.   Kenneth Lay, the Enron chairman and chief executive who built an empire from two troubled gas pipeline companies -- and whose influential friends include President Bush -- is the one who points to the bleachers. Dynegy s chairman and chief executive, Charles L. Watson, is less well known but is well respected among stock analysts. He also started small, nurturing his energy trading and generating company -- which had $33 billion in revenue for the nine months ended Sept. 30 -- from a natural gas trading concern he began in the mid-80 s. When electricity markets around the United States were deregulated, the companies followed clearly divergent paths. Utilities no longer necessarily generated power, and they and their larger industrial clients looked for good deals on the power being sold on the new wholesale markets for electricity. Enron and Dynegy traded and marketed energy. Yet Enron sold most of the power plants it owned and focused mainly on financial transactions rather than the actual physical delivery of power, a strategy that made the company a lot of money very fast. Dynegy bought power plants instead and focused on being a reliable supplier of energy. It cashed in, too, on deregulation, but not as Enron had. It stuck to its core energy business as its archrival branched into overseas operations, retail power marketing, a water business and a broadband venture, most of which have gone badly awry. Mr. Watson said in an interview earlier this year that a string of power plant acquisitions had kept his company diversified and balanced.   We need a little bit everywhere,   he said.   Enron is a financial player, but Dynegy is more of a physical player.   If Enron s finances grew more confusing, Dynegy seemed to offer clarity. If Enron promised a lot, analysts said, Dynegy played up its accomplishments. Enron lobbied regulators and politicians very publicly, while Dynegy kept things quiet and discreet.   Chuck Watson is a pretty straight-talking guy,   said Christopher R. Ellinghaus, a Williams Capital Group analyst. Because Enron had such extravagant earnings promises to fulfill, some analysts said, it may have been tempted to hide its problems and losses with creative accounting. While Dynegy avoided such a path, no one really expects Mr. Watson to gloat about his company s new, larger stature. Enron may have been less a hare than a canary in the deregulation coal mine, and it is unclear who will take on that role now.   Dynegy had what could be called a second-mover advantage,   said Andre Meade, head of Commerzbank Securities  United States utility research.   It seemed to be content to watch its larger rival up the street in Houston, Enron, go into a market. And if it was successful, Dynegy then could go in with less money and make it work.

OPPEL Jr. and ANDREW ROSS SORKIN11/09/2001The New York TimesPage 1, Column 2c. 2001 New York Times CompanyThe Enron Corporation yesterday sliced more than half a billion dollars from its reported profits over the last five years, but its crosstown rival, Dynegy Inc., still appeared to be willing to acquire Enron, executives close to the merger talks said. Worries about how bond rating agencies would react to the merger delayed announcement of the deal, the executives said. But the failure to announce a deal -- as well as the profit restatement -- caused Enron s share price to fall. And volume in its core North American natural gas and electricity trading operation plunged 20 percent as other energy-trading companies, unnerved by Enron s financial distress, steered business elsewhere.The boards of the two companies tentatively agreed late Wednesday night to a deal in which Dynegy would acquire Enron for about $8 billion in stock, or roughly $10 a share. The deal would include an initial $1.5 billion cash infusion from ChevronTexaco, which owns 27 percent of Dynegy, and later an additional infusion of $1 billion. The sticking point to proceeding with the deal, according to the executives, is whether Enron s credit rating will be reduced to   junk   status by the major credit rating agencies in reaction to Enron s disclosures and its plan to be acquired by Dynegy. Dynegy and Enron have provided pro forma statements of what a combined Dynegy-Enron would look like and asked Standard & Poor s and Moody s Investors Service for an   expedited review   of the transaction. Dynegy and ChevronTexaco are also privately considering whether to offer a bigger cash infusion to buoy Enron s credit rating -- now just two notches from falling below investment grade -- if the agencies look askance at the current deal. The companies are hoping for a response within the next day or two, the executives said. The executives also said Dynegy was seeking further protections that would allow it to back out of the deal if new, adverse disclosures surfaced. Shares of Dynegy rose sharply yesterday, although it was not clear whether buyers believed that the company -- one-quarter the size of Enron, in terms of revenues -- was getting a bargain or that Enron s latest disclosures would lead to the deal s being abandoned. Dynegy rose $3.50, or 10.6 percent, to $36.50, gaining back all of the ground lost on Wednesday after news of the deal leaked. Enron shares fell 64 cents, or 7.1 percent, to $8.41. Less than a year ago, Enron traded for more than $84 a share, and the company was valued at nearly $70 billion. In a sweeping restatement of its profits, Enron said that its actual net income for the years 1997 to 2000 was $591 million less than it had reported on its financial statements. In a filing with the S.E.C., Enron also indicated that part of last year s reported profits came from transactions with partnerships controlled by Andrew S. Fastow, who was the company s chief financial officer until he was ousted Oct. 24. Enron said the transactions involving Mr. Fastow, which are part of the S.E.C. investigation, earned the former executive more than $30 million. The company also said it had fired its treasurer and the general counsel of one of its divisions, who both had invested in one of the partnerships. Any deal would also face long and complex reviews by federal and state energy regulators, who would have to sort out a range of competitive issues in the still-young business of wholesale natural gas and electricity trading. Among the agencies involved would be the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department. Some analysts expressed hope that Enron s financial straits would encourage regulators to clear any deal, to relieve government officials of the prospect of dealing with the potential collapse of the nation s dominant energy-trading company. Enron handles about a quarter of all power trading, and higher proportions in some important regional markets.   If not for the dire condition of Enron today, we are not certain an Enron-Dynegy merger would be possible due to antitrust concerns,   said Christopher R. Ellinghaus, an analyst at Williams Capital.   However, the effective industry bailout that the merger would represent would probably lead to some leniency from the F.T.C., and would probably be looked at with some relief by the F.E.R.C.   It was clear yesterday there would be opposition to the deal.   If Dynegy and Enron were to get together, obviously the thing that would appeal to Dynegy would be to combine the trading function of the two entities, and that in itself would provide greater market power, not less market power,   said Raymond Plank, chairman of the Apache Corporation, one of the largest independent natural gas producers, based in Houston. Mr. Plank said he hoped regulators would take a critical look at any deal.   The thing they should take a look at is the concentration of market power that has led to excessive volatility, and as a result, once again is threatening North American gas producers.   Enron s restated profits almost wiped out its net income in 1997, and reduced it for every year since. But the changes actually raised its reported profits so far this year by $5 million. The changes came largely from including results of two special purpose partnerships that it had treated as being independent -- companies called Jedi and Chewco, after characters in the   Star Wars   movies -- and of including a subsidiary of a partnership called LJM1. That partnership, and another called LJM2, were run by Mr. Fastow. The remainder of the earnings reductions, totaling $92 million from 1997 through 2000, came from what Enron called   prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications,   which appear to have been changes previously recommended by Arthur Andersen, Enron s auditors, but not made because the auditors were persuaded the amounts were immaterial. Details of those charges were not disclosed, and Enron said it might further alter its reporting as a special board committee continues its investigation of the partnership transactions.   This is an unfortunate situation,   said David Tabolt, a spokesman for Arthur Andersen, which audited Enron s books in all the years in question.   Issues have surfaced that have caused the company to restate its financial statements and advise investors that they should not rely on Enron s financial statements or our audit reports. We are cooperating with the company and its special committee to bring resolution to these matters.   While the restated financial statements consolidated the results of two partnerships and the LJM1 subsidiary, they did not fold the entire LJM1 partnership or the LJM2 partnership into Enron s financials. It is not clear how those partnerships performed. Nor did they include some other related entities whose Enron-guaranteed debts have aroused concern among investors. Mr. Fastow, Enron s former chief financial officer, could not be reached for comment, his lawyer said. Enron s downward cascade began after it reported third-quarter earnings on Oct. 16. Its share price rose 67 cents, to $33.84, that day, as the company said its   recurring net income   had met analyst expectations, even though write-offs led to a net loss. In a conference call that day, Kenneth L. Lay, Enron s chairman, mentioned that the company had written down shareholder equity by $1.2 billion as it closed out its relationships with the LJM partnerships. In the following days, that figure became widely discussed as some investors concluded that the company had suffered a large loss that it was able to avoid reporting on the earnings statement. But Enron said yesterday that reduction should have been only $200 million, with the remaining $1 billion reduction simply reversing prior errors made in 2000 and early this year. Enron said it had set up procedures to monitor transactions with the LJM partnerships and assure they were proper.   Whether these controls were properly implemented   is being investigated by the special board committee, the company said. That committee has retained William McLucas, a former director of enforcement for the S.E.C., as well as accountants from Deloitte & Touche. The company had disclosed that Mr. Fastow was involved with the LJM partnerships, but it had not reported that any other Enron officials were involved. Yesterday it said that three officers of the company, as well as another employee, had invested in an LJM1 subsidiary in March 2000. The officers were Ben Glisen, the company s treasurer; Kristina Mordaunt, the general counsel of an Enron division; and Kathy Lynn, vice president of an Enron division. The company said Ms. Lynn no longer worked for Enron and that the company was   terminating the employment   of the other two. Some industry officials said yesterday that a deal with Dynegy was increasingly looking like a do-or-die prospect for Enron, as other energy-trading companies began to back away from the company and take their business to other trading companies. While Enron has a large network of natural gas pipelines and other profitable assets, by far its most valuable franchise is its energy-trading business in North America, which acts as an intermediary in more gas and electricity trades than any other company. Yesterday, volume in that business dropped 20 percent. An Enron spokesman said company traders attributed the drop to concerns about the S.E.C. investigation and the outcome of the merger talks with Dynegy. Enron also canceled a planned meeting with its creditors today in Houston, executives said. The agenda for the meeting had been an extension of its $3 billion credit lines, but the merger talks superseded that discussion.Photo: Dynegy s chief executive, Charles L.

Dynegy Halts Talks With Enron, Awaits Credit Rating (Update1)2001-11-09 06:48 (New York)Dynegy Halts Talks With Enron, Awaits Credit Rating (Update1)     (Adds European share trading in fourth paragraph.)     Houston, Nov. 9 (Bloomberg) -- Dynegy Inc. s plan to buyrival energy trader Enron Corp. has stalled pending a creditreview by Moody s Investors Service, people familiar with thetalks said. Dynegy will probably walk away if Enron receives a``junk   credit rating, the people said.     The proposed takeover, for about $8 billion in stock, hit asnag because of the threat of a downgrade that would trigger acash crisis by forcing Enron to repay $3.3 billion of bonds early.Moody s and Standard & Poor s are considering lowering theirratings, which are two levels above junk.     A rating below investment-grade would make it ``difficult ifnot impossible to raise new debt and would severely hamper theirability to trade,   Jefferies & Co. energy analyst Paul Fremontsaid. Fremont doesn t have a rating on Enron s stock or bonds.     Enron shares slid 39 cents to $8.02 in Germany. Enronspokesman Mark Palmer declined to comment. Dynegy spokesman JohnSouza declined to comment on the possibility of a downgrade byMoody s. Souza said talks with Enron on an acquisition werecontinuing.     Bankers are lobbying Moody s to make a quick decision so anacquisition could proceed, according to the people. Moody sanalyst Stephen Moore cut the company s rating to ``Baa2   on Oct.29, the second reduction in less than two weeks.     At that time, Moore said he would be ``tracking very closelytheir wholesale volumes   of energy trading. ``That will be theleading indicator of where the company is going.

Without an investment-quality rating, Enron would have topost collateral for trades, making it more difficult to dobusiness, said Michael Morrell, president of the trading arm ofAllegheny Energy Inc., a Maryland utility owner. ``It would betrue for us, and I would think for many others,   he said.     Atlanta-based Mirant Corp., a top U.S. energy trader, hasmoved most of its trades away from Enron to other exchanges, suchas the Intercontinental Exchange, a venture formed in March 2000with other partners including BP Plc and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,Mirant spokesman James Peters said.     The earnings restatement may also justify a credit downgrade,said Donald Coxe, who manages 78,000 Enron shares as part of theHarris Insight Equity Fund. ``This shows the company was runscandalously,   he said.     Investor concern is reflected in the decline in Enron s 7.88percent notes that mature in 2003 in the past month. The notes,which were unchanged yesterday at 77 cents on the dollar, nowyield about 27 percent. The debt was trading near 100 last month.

The combined 2000 revenue of the twocompanies is $130 billion.     Dynegy also would inherit shareholder lawsuits over thepartnerships, and some troubled assets, including Enron s 65percent stake in the $3 billion Dabhol Power Co. in India, owed$64 million by India s Maharashtra state, said CommerzbankSecurities analyst Andre Meade.     ``You buy a lot of fleas when you buy Enron,   said Meade,who rates Enron ``accumulate   and owns no shares.

Imagine the headache Enron Corp. is facing. On Thursday, the company admitted it s found a few errors, too -- close to $600 million in mistakes spread over the past 4 1/2 years. The energy giant said it is restating its finances as far back as 1997 to account for losses related to a number of complex partnerships, including several under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. This includes a $586 million reduction in net income, an additional $2.5 billion in debt and a 77-cent reduction in earnings per share. Enron also said it has fired a number of employees who invested directly in the partnerships and is investigating if others had improper dealings. The announcements came on the same day the company confirmed it was in negotiations to merge with cross-street rival Dynegy Corp. Directors with both companies have been in round-the-clock meetings in recent days, hammering out a deal. The revelations, outlined in a document Enron filed with the SEC Thursday morning, shine a bit of light onto issues that for weeks have been cloaked in shadows and out of sight of Wall Street analysts and investors. That includes investment partnerships that led to a $1.2 billion loss for the company last quarter, as well as other deals formed by the company s former chief financial officer that may have been a conflict of interest. The company s reluctance to share detailed information on the partnerships since they first arose last month left many to assume the worst. Enron s stock price plummeted, credit agencies slashed its ratings and trading partners began to shop their business around to competitors. Enron chief executive Ken Lay said the release of information was aimed to calm the concerns of shareholders and federal investigators. For all practical purposes it came too late. ""At the end of the day these details give support to the fear that Enron was a financial house of cards,"" said John Olson, an analyst with Sanders Morris Harris. ""It would make a good case study on what happens when you fly too close to the sun."" The turmoil started shortly after Oct. 16, when steep losses in Enron s third-quarter earnings drew renewed attention to a pair of investment partnerships created by former CFO Andy Fastow with the approval of the company s board of directors. The partnerships, called LJM1 and LJM2, were formed using Enron equity and outside capital as a way to hedge against the risks involved in some of the company s new lines of business, such as Internet broadband trading and water. They were also designed to help the company grow quickly without adding too much debt to its books or diluting the value of the company s stock. Fastow s dual roles as Enron CFO and managing director of the entities were a cause for concern for Wall Street because it would put him on both sides of some of the deals, representing both the buyers and sellers simultaneously. The company said it was careful to assure there were no conflicts of interest, but under pressure from investors Fastow resigned from those partnerships last summer. Fastow earned as much as $30 million through his role with the partnerships, while a number of other Enron employees also invested in them personally. Two of those employees -- Ben Glisan, a managing director and treasurer of Enron Corp., and Kristina Mordaunt, a managing director and general counsel of an Enron division -- were terminated by Enron this week. The other employees, including Fastow and executives Michael Kopper, Kathy Lynn and Anne Yeager, no longer work for Enron. While the transactions themselves do not appear to have been illegal, the way some of them were recorded in Enron s financial statements led to the corrections. Specifically, Enron said that special entities it created named Chewco Investments L.P. and Joint Energy Development Investments L.P. should have been consolidated back onto its books in November 1997. The LJM1 partnership should have been consolidated into the company s financial statements in 1999. While Fastow is credited with creating the strategy behind the complex financing deals, observers say the plans were reviewed and approved by Enron s board of directors and other officers. The results of all the deals and how they were recorded on the company s financial statements had to go through the office of Chief Accounting Officer Richard Causey and through Enron s accounting firm, Andersen. ""You couldn t slip these things by anyone,"" Olson said. ""They re simply too big, and too many people were involved for it to go unnoticed."" Thursday s filing details some of the complex financing deals between Enron and LJM1 and LJM2. Enron formed LJM1 and LJM2 in 1999 with infusions of its own cash and stock. Other investors, such as pension funds and banks, also invested millions of dollars more into the partnerships. These investors included Credit Suisse First Boston, Wachovia, General Electric and the Arkansas Teachers Fund, among others. Fastow was managing partner of both entities. The idea behind LJM1 and LJM2 was for them to become sources of capital to buy assets from Enron, co-invest with Enron in certain projects and to take equity stakes in other companies to spread the risk of those businesses. Between June 1999 and September 2001 Enron and Enron-affiliated entities did 24 deals with LJM1 or LJM2 or both, ranging from buying and selling hard assets, purchasing debt or equity interests, and selling the rights to buy or sell shares of stock at certain preset prices. While Enron provided descriptions of the many deals on Thursday, their complexity can be mind-numbing for anyone who isn t an accountant. For example, in June 2000, LJM2 purchased fiber-optic cable from Enron that was installed yet unused for $30 million in cash and $70 million in an interest-bearing note, or IOU. LJM2 sold some of that fiber to other companies for $40 million, but since Enron helped market the fiber to those buyers it received an ""agency fee"" of $20.3 million. In December 2000, LJM2 sold the remaining fiber for $113 million to a special entity that Enron created strictly for the purpose of that purchase. LJM2 then used some of the proceeds from the sale to pay off the $70 million Enron IOU. As if the transaction weren t complicated enough, Enron then signed a contract with one of the investors of the entity that paid $113 million for the fiber to help cushion that investor from any potential losses. The transactions were completely legal and earned LJM2 $2.4 million and reduced Enron s credit risk on the transaction by $9 million. The fact that the earnings rely so heavily on business between such closely related entities is disturbing, however. ""These intra-company transaction were totally exotic,"" Olson said. Christopher Ellinghaus, an analyst with Willams Capital in New York, said the revelations have made many ""very alert to the shenanigans at Enron."" ""Enron just likes to be fancy,"" he said. ""They may have been too fancy for their own good."" Bottom of Form 1Nov. 9, 2001Houston ChronicleEnron, Dynegy still talking merger Smaller energy trader s shares up; analysts see it poised to profit By LAURA GOLDBERG Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle Merger discussions between Dynegy and Enron Corp. continued Thursday as Wall Street had a mixed reaction to a possible combination of the two Houston energy traders. Investors traded up Dynegy s shares, while several stock analysts raised questions. Sources told the Chronicle Wednesday that the two companies were in advanced talks for the smaller Dynegy to buy out its troubled rival. A stock deal likely to be worth $7 billion to $8 billion was being discussed. In addition, ChevronTexaco Corp., which owns about 27 percent of Dynegy, could give Enron an immediate infusion of $1.5 billion to help stabilize its finances and keep its core trading business running smoothly. Dynegy, the people said, was offering a modest premium over Enron s stock price, but Enron had been pressing for a higher offer. Shares in Enron closed at $9.67 Tuesday, $9.05 Wednesday and $8.41 Thursday. Each company issued a statement Thursday saying the two were in discussions about ""a possible business combination."" Neither plans additional comments until a deal is struck or the talks fail. The statements came as Enron said it is restating its finances as far back as 1997 to include losses related to a number of complex partnerships it created, including several being investigated by federal securities regulators. Enron has been under heavy fire since Oct. 16, when it released third-quarter earnings that included losses related to two investment partnerships formerly run by its since-replaced chief financial officer. Carol Coale, an analyst with Prudential Securities in Houston, is to meet with top Dynegy executives today. She has a number of questions about a possible merger, including why Dynegy wants to buy Enron when its best resource, its people, could cross the street and turn in r?sum?s. She also wonders why Ken Lay, Enron s chairman and chief executive, is apparently willing to sell Enron at such a low price. ""What does he know that we don t know?"" Coale asked. But Coale also got the sense Dynegy executives are doing their homework and moving with caution, which she said is positive. A Dynegy buyout of Enron has the potential to be ""highly accretive"" to Dynegy s bottom line depending on the price paid, said Ronald Barone, an analyst at UBS Warburg in New York. ""The new company would be a global powerhouse,"" he said. ""There are significant synergies that can be realized to enhance value."" Shares in Dynegy closed up $3.50 Thursday to $36.50. Investors liked two opposite prospects, said Jeff Dietert, an analyst with Simmons & Co. International in Houston. On the one hand, investors see potential for Dynegy to add profits by buying Enron, he said. But if no deal happens, they also see a chance for Dynegy to take business away from a weakened Enron. He expects any deal Dynegy signs to give it an escape if the Securities and Exchange Commission should conclude Enron acted illegally. Government regulators would have to review a merger, looking to see if too much market concentration would result. With a merger, Dynegy would increase its trading and marketing share in the North American natural gas market from about 6 percent to about 21 percent, said John Olson, an analyst with Sanders Harris Morris in Houston. For electricity, Dynegy s numbers would go from about 6 percent to about 23 percent, he said. Andre Meade, an analyst with Commerzbank Securities in New York, doesn t believe regulators would find a market concentration problem. ""It s a pretty fractionalized industry with plenty of competition,"" he said. Meade called an Enron-Dynegy merger ""a mixed bag,"" as it would let Dynegy cut costs and lead the energy trading market. ""However, I don t think it s as easy as it sounds,"" he said, adding that a successful merger would take the correct incentives to convince Enron s traders to work for the new company. ""Whenever you merge with or buy a human-capital-based business, it s risky."" Bottom of Form 1A new energy crisis: If master market maker Enron goes down, this winter could be a truly chilling experience for North Americans.(Enron Corp. in danger of defaulting)(Brief Article)DONALD COXE11/12/2001Maclean s33Copyright 2001 Gale Group Inc. All rights reserved. COPYRIGHT 2001 Maclean Hunter Canadian Publishing Ltd.Do the sustained bear raids on Enron Corp. portend chaotic conditions in the energy markets? That is the $64-billion question. Bearish stock markets are the indispensable scavengers of capitalism. They clean up the financial and economic landscape and kill off disease-carrying pests. True believers in free markets should rejoice when bears rush in after a prolonged period of misbehaviour has fouled the financial environment. Those of us who thought the energy industry would escape the great technology bear market may have been too complacent. In recent weeks, the biggest loser on the New York Stock Exchange has not been a tech stock, but Enron, a component of the Dow Jones utilities index. Enron s high was $89.06 a share, and as recently as August it was trading at $45. In recent weeks, Enron s shares have plunged, closing last week below $12.33 That collapse has sent shock waves through the capital markets. What may be even more significant for energy producers and users is the valuation of Enron s bonds: they are trading at distressed prices, offering yields comparable to junk bonds. The ratings services have turned highly negative on Enron, although they still rate it an investment-grade credit. (I regret -- oh how I regret! -- that I must disclose before proceeding further that investment funds I manage have, at this writing, exposure to Enron stock, acquired at prices substantially above current markets.) For Canadians unfamiliar with Enron and its place in U.S. energy markets, here is an introduction: Voltaire summed up the entire 18th- century deistic proof of the existence of God by saying, ""If God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him."" It s the same with Enron. U.S. energy markets needed a prime mover. Prior to Enron, these markets (other than crude oil) were relatively primitive and inefficient. Neither producers nor consumers had means to hedge their risks effectively, and long-term contracts were made -- if at all -- under circumstances of grossly inadequate information. The futures market for natural gas was spotty and unreliable, and no futures market for electricity existed. Enter Enron. In the past half- dozen years, Enron became the greatest trading house for energy in the world. Its willingness to make markets in energy futures in almost any amount transformed the markets for electric power and gave natural gas producers and consumers reliable hedging and financing opportunities, day in, day out. By putting its own capital on the line to make trades, Enron created depth, liquidity and transparency in energy markets. So active were those markets that they gave price signals to all who would follow them. Conspicuous among those who didn t were the policy-makers in California. Had Gov. Gray Davis and his top officials followed the developments in electricity futures, they would have realized the real nature of the risks facing consumers in the Golden State. Instead, they let a crisis develop, and then locked in long-term purchase contracts at all-time record-high prices just before they collapsed to normal levels. By some estimates, Enron is on one side or the other of 25 per cent of all outstanding futures contracts in natural gas and electricity. Since these contracts extend years ahead, and since the other parties to those trades are relying on Enron s ability to cover its obligations, the risks to energy prices and supplies could be enormous if Enron were to default. That still seems extremely improbable. Contracts executed through the public futures markets have the financial protection of those exchanges for Enron s ""counterparties"" (the term for the other side of a futures contract). But Enron has enormous exposure through direct deals that have no such protection. What has hammered Enron s securities lately is the unfolding story of gigantic off-balance-sheet deals the company made with partnerships that included, astonishingly enough, the chief financial officer, who was finally forced to go on leave. These partnership deals were never really disclosed, except in obscure balance sheet notes that gave no indication of the scale of the deals or that a senior company officer was involved. Why should investors who aren t owners of Enron stock or bonds care? Because the past year has seen the biggest swings in natural gas and electricity prices in history, and some observers wonder whether Enron s internal problems exacerbated those swings. Worse, if Enron has to withdraw from the markets, what about the billions in forward hedging contracts that producers and consumers have in place? Many U.S. energy producers locked in high prices by making huge forward sales. If those contracts are voided, defaults could spread through the system, throwing energy markets into chaos. There were enough problems in the energy-short U.S. even when Enron was keeping the markets functioning. If the master market maker goes down, or is forced to curtail its operations, this winter could be a truly chilling experience for North Americans. When Bush and Cheney aren t worrying about bin Laden or anthrax, they may be worrying about Enron.

ENRON IN CRISIS - Restated figures show how earnings were cut.By ROBERT CLOW.11/09/2001Financial Times(c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights ReservedENRON IN CRISIS - Restated figures show how earnings were cut - SEC FILING - Energy trading group admits that several of its special-purpose entities should have been consolidated on the balance sheet. Enron yesterday marked four years of earnings down sharply after taking account of off-balance-sheet dealings.The company admitted that several of its off-balance-sheet, special-purpose entities should have been consolidated on its balance sheet. The effect of the change was to reduce earnings substantially in each year from 1997 to 2000; from $105m to $9m in 1997, from $703m to $590m in 1998, from $893m to $643m in 1999 and from $979m to $847m in 2000. This year s earnings were marginally increased but the company s third-quarter loss widened marginally from $618m to $635m. In the Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Enron also announced the dismissal of two more officials: Ben Glisan, the company s treasurer, and Kristina Mordaunt, general counsel for one division. Enron ran into trouble on October 16, when it announced a $1.2bn reduction of shareholders  equity and a $1.01bn charge. Yesterday s filing goes some way to explaining how the charge came about. Enron attributed the charge to dealings with LJM, a private equity fund run by Andrew Fastow, formerly Enron chief financial officer. Private equity investments have injected enormous volatility into the earnings of companies, such as JP Morgan Chase. Keeping LJM off the balance sheet allowed Enron to avoid major swings. But to prevent LJM being consolidated, Enron had to own less than half of the special-purpose vehicle, and for outside investors to participate they had to be compensated. What that meant was that when the value of Enron s private equity investments fell below a certain level, people familiar with Enron s balance sheet said, co-investors would receive Enron stock. The Enron filing reveals that the LJM losses arose from another group of special-purpose entities, known as the Raptor vehicles, which were designed in part to hedge an Enron investment in a bankrupt broadband company, Rhythm NetConnections. The $1.2bn reduction in shareholders  equity arose from the termination of the Raptor hedging arrangements, which if they had continued would have resulted in Enron issuing 58m shares to offset the company s private equity losses. Enron also revealed that Mr Fastow was paid in excess of $30m as a result of his role in running LJM. At issue is whether Mr Fastow was acting in the best interests of other Enron shareholders. The filing also raises questions about Enron s cash flow, which will be studied carefully by the rating agencies and creditors. A group of banks, including Barclays Bank, Credit Suisse First Boston, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup, have lent more than $4bn to Enron over the last weeks, much of it not collateralised. By reducing its earnings by more than $100m for several years, Enron has created concern about its ability to service debt. On the balance sheet, Enron owes $12.8bn. Off-balance-sheet entities related to Enron owe $8bn-$9bn. Enron generates about $3bn cashflow annually, but despite claiming to be cashflow-positive, its borrowings rose significantly last year.

Swanson <mailto:kcswanson@thestreet.com>Staff ReporterTheStreet.com11/09/2001 07:09 AM ESTURL: <http://www.thestreet.com/markets/dumbest/10003700.html>1. Mangia, Mangia! Er -- Scratch That The Securities and Exchange Commission has suspended trading in 2DoTrade (TDOT.OB:OTC BB - news - commentary) , doubting the company s claim that it is prepared to distribute a disinfectant for anthrax. No wonder the agency is skeptical: Biotechnology seems a bit far afield from 2DoTrade s goal of developing a business-to-business platform for the African continent. It s even farther removed from the company s original mission: According to a report filed with the SEC, it wanted to start a chain of full-service, white-tablecloth Italian restaurants ""based on authentic Italian regional recipes."" That plan was abandoned last spring. In the meantime, it still has no revenue. 2DoTrade says it has cumulative losses of $29,000 because it s still in the development stage. A report on its Web site suggests the stock is ""an exceptional ground-floor opportunity [for the] investor with vision."" But the SEC has publicly questioned the company s prospects, the existence of its alleged contracts, and the identity of its managers. 2. Treasury Department At It AgainChalk up one more blunder for the Treasury Department. In the current fiasco, the SEC has said it s investigating the early release of news that the Treasury Department would stop selling 30-year bonds. The Treasury apparently screwed up on two counts: Not only did it allow the news to leak out early through a third party (a consultant who attended a department briefing without press credentials), but it also posted the information on its own Web site before it was publicly announced. So it can t simply blame the premature disclosure on someone else s bad judgment. Disclosure of the mistake is sure to further annoy bond traders, who were already piqued that the government had given no hint at the policy shift. According to press reports, many bond trading desks suffered big losses because they were caught unawares. 3. It Doth Protest Too MuchHewlett-Packard s (HWP:NYSE - news - commentary) affirmation of ""enthusiastic support"" this week for the merger with Compaq (CPQ:NYSE - news - commentary) rings a bit hollow, given that H-P s stock has seen double-digit losses since the merger was announced. The board s recent frozen-smile commentary came on news that some of the company s most influential investors, members of the Hewlett and Packard families, oppose the deal and will vote against the merger if given the chance. The move by H-P heirs was all the more damaging because they control a large chunk of stock: According to press reports, the Hewletts own over 5%, while an institute affiliated with the Packard family holds more than 1%. Even before the family members weighed in, investor disapproval of the merger was manifest. As TSC has reported, stocks of both companies have dropped sharply after the deal was announced, slicing $6 billion off the deal s initial value of $25 billion. But after news that the Hewlett family would oppose the deal, cheered investors bid up H-P 17% in just one day. It s not often that the board of a company and its investors are at loggerheads -- and regarding the board s mood, we re reckoning panic might be more accurate than enthusiasm. 4. NYSE Lagging In SurveillanceTwo years after the NYSE was embroiled in an illegal trading scandal, oversight of floor brokers is still too lax, according to government regulators. Their report, released to members of a congressional committee in September, was made public this week. It says the Big Board has made ""significant progress"" in regulating brokers, but deficiencies remain: Among other things, the NYSE needs to improve surveillance of floor members, ensuring that regulators are on the trading floor to watch for potential violations. In 1999, nine brokers pleaded guilty to criminal charges related to schemes in which they took a share of trading profits. At least 64 brokers took part in profit-sharing arrangements until 1998, according to the SEC. No doubt the NYSE s regulatory improvements are commendable -- just hope it doesn t take another two years for the exchange to get its practices completely up to par. 5. Enron, Once AgainEnron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) to shareholders: ""Heyyyyyy, guys? You know all those financial statements we ve been giving you for the last five years? Uhh ... they were totally wrong. Sorry."" Yes, just when it seems Enron has exhausted its considerable reserves of dumb things, the company surprises and produces yet another. This time Enron announced it would restate earnings from 1997 through the second quarter of 2001. ""Financial statements for these periods ... should not be relied upon,"" the company said, in a statement likely to obliterate any lingering vestiges of credibility. The adjustments to its financial statements reduced profits over the period by a total of over a half-billion dollars, while the accounting changes magically produced an additional $2.59 billion in debt. The announcement comes amid reports that Dynegy (DYN:NYSE - news - commentary) is in talks to buy Enron. With Enron s stock down about 90% from a year ago, at least it s likely to be cheap -- though it would be a stretch to call it a bargain under these circumstances. GLOBAL INVESTING - Shareholder-friendly companies outperform STUDY FINDS GIVING MORE POWER TO INVESTORS ...By ALISON BEARD.11/09/2001Financial Times(c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights ReservedGLOBAL INVESTING - Shareholder-friendly companies outperform STUDY FINDS GIVING MORE POWER TO INVESTORS HAS PRODUCED BETTER RETURNS THAN PROTECTING MANAGEMENT. Companies that protected management rights with poison pills, classified boards and other anti-takeover tools significantly underperformed businesses that gave more power to shareholders through the 1990s, according to a new study.A survey of 1,500 companies found that those with the most pro-management provisions generated annual returns that were 8.5 per cent less than companies that favoured outside investors. ""There are broad variations across companies as to whether they are democracies or dictatorships,"" said Andrew Metrick, a finance professor at the Wharton School of Business, who wrote the study with Paul Gompers and Joy Ishii of Harvard University. ""What we found was that the democracies did better."" After the takeover craze of the 1980s, companies scrambled to enact provisions that would help executives defend against corporate raiders. Typical provisions included poison pills, which allow all pro-management shareholders to buy stock at discounts during takeover attempts diluting the power of the hostile bidder; super-majority votes, which require from 66 to 85 per cent approval for a management change rather than a majority; golden parachutes, which give large compensation packages to executives who are fired or demoted; and classified boards, whereby board members  terms are staggered, preventing them from all being ousted at the same time. The stock market downturn and well publicised cases of corporate mismanagement, including this month s Enron controversy, have made investors increasingly wary of such pro-management stances. Last week, California Public Employees Retirement System, the largest US pension fund, won its fight to declassify the board of Metromedia International Group, the emerging markets communications company. This week the fund is discussing Enron. Other investors in the energy merchant have already filed law suits against company officials, alleging fraud and seeking to recover their lost share value, estimated at $20bn over the last month. Hewlett-Packard shareholders were also asserting their rights this week. The Hewlett family, which still holds a 5 per cent stake in the computer company, announced it would oppose management s plan to merge with Compaq. Mr Metrick s study lists HP as one of the most shareholder-friendly companies in 1990 among the 1,500 he evaluated. Companies were given one point for every by-law that reduced shareholder rights. Aside from HP, those with the lowest scores - or highest level of shareholder power - were IBM, Wal-Mart, DuPont, PepsiCo, American International Group, Southern Company, Berkshire Hathaway, Commonwealth Edison, and Texas Utilities. The companies with the highest - or most pro-management - scores in 1990 included GTE, Waste Management, General Re, The Limited, NCR, Kmart, United Telecommunications, Time Warner, Rorer and Woolworth. From 1990 to 1999, the first group outperformed the Standard & Poor s 500 by 3.5 percentage points each year from 1990 to 1999, the second group trailed the index by about 5 points. An investor who bought the pro-shareholder stocks and sold short the pro-management stocks could have captured that 8.5 per cent difference. The study also found that the pro-management companies had lower sales growth and less profits than other firms in their industry. However, Mr Metrick stresses that the findings do not prove causation. Strong management provisions do not necessarily undermine stock performance, nor do shareholder rights always lead to better returns. ""What we do know is that companies that gave shareholders rights did better than those that didn t in the 1990s ... so maybe if the companies that don t give shareholder rights gave them, their stock would do a lot better going forward,"" he said. ""Maybe investors should be looking for that change. But that is the question the paper doesn t answer."" (c) Copyright Financial Times Ltd.

GLOBAL INVESTING - Putting a value on a group under siege.By JOHN DIZARD.11/09/2001Financial Times(c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights ReservedRisk arbitrageurs, the people who bet on the price and likelihood of mergers and acquisitions taking place, need nerves of bomb disposal experts. They need to know more than the public about deals and potential deals that usually attract a lot of interest from the media and other analysts, which means getting an edge is harder than with non-deal stocks. The planned acquisition of Enron by Dynegy is a case in point. The deal is ""subject to"" the usual conditions - the SEC, antitrust authorities and, of course, the due diligence work on the valuation of the underlying assets and businesses. But buying Enron stock in the hope that the valuation will turn out to be above the present price may be a slightly ambitious strategy for even the most well informed investors.The book value of the company is supposed to be about $11bn, which would be a couple of bucks higher than the current stock price. And the ultimate purchase price should - repeat, should, not must - be above that book value. However, in any company where the financial managers of a week ago are not only on the street but under invest-igation, you have to wonder if a ""take-under"" at a low stock price is a possibility. Nevertheless, all the panic had spread from the febrile world of equities to the normally less excitable one of bonds, which has created a much lower risk opp-ortunity. For example, the Enron 7 7/8 per cent bonds of 2003 were trading yesterday with bids in the high 60s and offers in the low 70s. That represents a yield to maturity of 22 per cent - not bad for 18-month paper. The question of the underlying value in Enron comes down to two risks: the contingent liabilities from the widely discussed off-balance-sheet vehicles that it used to swap assets for financings, and the safety of the trading accounts. The off-balance-sheet companies have already been combed over and their effects on the parent balance sheet restated, with the results reported yesterday. The contingent commitments do not affect the value of the assets backi"

Lay, a big contributor to the Republican Party, pr=ovided political influence, while its former chief executive, Jeffrey K. Sk=illing, helped create markets for the trading of electricity and natural ga=s. But last winter, when California s effort to deregulate the electricity =market led to soaring power prices and rolling blackouts, Enron was the sub=ject of much criticism and political anger.=20Recent disclosures of discrepancies in Enron s financial statements and an =investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission caused the shares t=o plunge this week to their lowest level in a decade. As other companies be=came wary of doing business with it, Enron -- also facing a potential cash =squeeze -- apparently had little choice but to find a buyer, and a deal was= hastily cobbled together this week.=20For critics who had complained about Enron s market power and its dominance=, the combination poses additional concerns. Dynegy s acquisition of Enron =will be reviewed by state and federal agencies, led by the Justice Departme=nt and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Analysts said today that t=hey expected scrutiny of the combined companies  holdings in California, wh=ere Dynegy owns power-generating plants and Enron accounts for much of the =trading of natural gas -- fuel for the state s electric power plants.=20Buying Enron at a deep discount -- it has lost $60 billion in market value =this year -- could make Dynegy the dominant trader of electricity and natur=al gas. But the agreement carries big risks as well. Along with Enron s gas= pipelines and high-technology trading floor, Dynegy will take on Enron s s=ubstantial debt and a web of complex transactions that Enron has spun over =the last decade.=20In addition to the $13 billion in debt that Enron carries on its books, it =has guaranteed at least $4 billion in off-balance sheet loans, and the hidd=en debt could total as much as $10 billion, said Carol Coale, a stock analy=st with Prudential Securities.=20Charles L. Watson, Dynegy s chairman and chief executive, said yesterday th=at Dynegy could sort through Enron s tangled finances.   We know the compan=y well,   Mr. Watson said.   It s not like we just started fresh. I m confi=dent that it s as solid as we thought it was.  =20The new company will combine Enron s 25,000-mile natural gas pipeline syste=m with the large number of power plants that Dynegy owns worldwide, as well= as Illinois Power, a Dynegy subsidiary that serves 650,000 customers in Il=linois. But its most important asset will be its trading desk. It will be t=he largest energy trader in the nation, trading more than twice as much pow=er and natural gas as its closest competitors.=20Mr. Watson said the company did not expect to sell significant properties a=nd that the deal should pass regulatory scrutiny.   There s really not a lo=t of overlap in assets,   he said.=20Mr. Watson and Steve Bergstrom, Dynegy s president, will hold those positio=ns in the new company, which will be called Dynegy and remain in Houston. M=r. Lay, who created Enron in the mid-1980 s, will not have any role in the =combined company s daily operations. He has been asked to join its board bu=t has not provided an answer.   The last three weeks haven t been a lot of =fun,   he said.=20In a statement announcing the agreement yesterday afternoon, Mr. Watson sai=d he was confident that the merger would produce a strong new company.   En=ron is the ideal strategic partner for Dynegy,   Mr. Watson said.   We will= keep a strong balance sheet and straightforward financial structure as key= priorities.  =20To shore up Enron s finances, Dynegy will immediately put $1.5 billion into= Enron through ChevronTexaco, the giant oil company, which already owns 27 =percent of Dynegy. Another billion dollars will be injected once the deal i=s completed.=20Investors appeared comfortable yesterday that Dynegy could make the deal wo=rk. After falling $3, to $33, on Wednesday, when the companies first said t=hey were in discussions, Dynegy rose $5.76 on Thursday and yesterday to clo=se the week at $38.76.=20  On paper, it works,   Ms. Coale of Prudential said.   The combined compan=y would be the leading trader, the market leader in most of their businesse=s.   Ms. Coale, who has a sell rating on Enron and a buy rating on Dynegy, =said she planned to keep her buy rating on Dynegy.=20As it works to have the deal approved, Dynegy will have to persuade Enron s= traders to stay with the combined company. The pain of the stock s 90 perc=ent plunge this year will not be equally shared. Some Enron employees have =held onto their shares and seen their retirement accounts eviscerated. Mean=while, Mr. Lay, Mr. Skilling and other former and current executives sold h=undreds of millions of dollars in Enron stock in 2000 and this year.=20The companies also have very different corporate cultures. Dynegy emphasize=s teamwork, while Enron is more competitive, said Ehud Ronn, director of th=e Center for Energy Finance Education and Research at the University of Tex=as. Even before the merger was announced, Enron had lost some of its employ=ees to other energy trading companies, Mr. Ronn said.=20Some investors and analysts say that the problems with Enron s finances may= extend beyond the partnerships that have been the subject of Wall Street s= scrutiny the last month. James Chanos, a short-seller who has been one of =Enron s most vocal critics, said there was increasing evidence that Enron s= energy trading operations were not as profitable as the company had said. =  There appears to be a culture at Enron of aggressively booking profits an=d deferring or obscuring losses,   Mr. Chanos said.=20On Thursday, Enron said in a filing with the S.E.C that it had overstated i=ts earnings by almost $600 million over the last five years. Mr. Chanos sai=d more restatements were possible, noting that the filing disclosed partner=ships had been used to hedge almost $1 billion in losses in 2000 and this y=ear. So far, the losses from those partnerships remain off Enron s financia=l statements, Mr. Chanos said.=20Enron s stock had been under pressure for most of this year, as the company= ran up large losses with failed efforts to expand outside its core trading= operation. In August, Mr. Skilling resigned as chief executive, and Mr. La=y resumed control of daily operations.=20Still, the company appeared financially sound until last month, when it dis=closed that its shareholders  equity, a measure of the company s value, dro=pped by $1.2 billion because of deals disclosed only hazily in its financia=l statements. The announcement unnerved investors, who wondered whether Enr=on had found ways to inflate its profits and move debt off its balance shee=t, and led the S.E.C. to begin an investigation.=20Mr. Lay tried to reassure investors that Enron s finances were in order and= that its businesses remained strong. But the last three weeks have brought= a series of damaging revelations about partnerships that Enron formed with= some of its top executives, including its former chief financial officer, =Andrew S. Fastow.=20With questions mounting, the major credit-rating agencies began to downgrad=e Enron s debt, putting additional pressure on the company. If Enron s debt= rating falls below investment grade, it would be forced to repay $3.3 bill=ion in loans that it had guaranteed.=20To strengthen its balance sheet and bolster its stock, Enron turned to big =investors like Warren E. Buffett in search of billions of dollars of financ=ing. When the financing did not quickly appear, its stock fell further.=20By this week, some major energy traders were refusing to extend credit to E=nron, worrying that the company would be unable to make good on its contrac=ts. The Mirant Corporation, an Atlanta-based power plant owner and electric=ity trader, sharply curtailed its trading with Enron this week.   We re tra=ding with them on a very limited basis,   said James Peters, a Mirant spoke=sman.   It s not business as usual.  =20On Wednesday, Enron s stock fell as low as $7 a share, its lowest level in =more than a decade. That day, news of the Enron and Dynegy talks leaked out=.=20By late Wednesday, the boards of the two companies had tentatively agreed t=o a deal. But Dynegy refused to go ahead until it learned whether Enron s c=redit rating would remain investment grade and was comfortable with the eff=ect of the deal on its own rating. The deal moved forward yesterday after D=ynegy was assured Enron s debt was not in danger of being lowered to junk s=tatus soon after the deal was announced, according to company officials.=20Dynegy and Enron had provided Standard & Poor s and Moody s Investors Servi=ce, the main credit agencies, with statements showing them what a combined =company might look like and asked the ratings agencies for an expedited rev=iew of the transaction, Mr. Watson said.=20Under the deal, Enron shareholders will receive 0.2685 share of Dynegy stoc=k for each Enron share, or $9.80 based on Dynegy s closing price on Thursda=y. Enron s stock gained 22 cents yesterday, to $8.63.=20  I never thought our stock price would be at this level,   Mr. Lay said ye=sterday.=20Enron s shareholders will own only 36 percent of the combined company, and =Dynegy will name at least 11 members of the company s 14-member board.=20If the deal falls apart, Enron or Dynegy will have to pay a breakup fee of =$350 million.=20To protect Dynegy s and ChevronTexaco s cash infusion, the money will go to= an Enron unit that owns the Northern Natural Gas Pipeline.

OPPEL Jr.11/10/2001The New York TimesPage 1, Column 2c. 2001 New York Times CompanyWASHINGTON, Nov. 9 -- For years, the Enron Corporation used its political m=uscle to build the markets in which it thrived, pushing relentlessly on Cap=itol Hill and in bureaucratic backwaters to deregulate the nation s natural= gas and electricity businesses.=20Its achievement, as one Enron executive said today, in creating a   regulat=ory black hole   fit nicely with what he called the company s   core manage=ment philosophy, which was to be the first mover into a market and to make =money in the initial chaos and lack of transparency.  Now, Wall Street s dissatisfaction with Enron s secretive ways has delivere=d the company into the arms of its much smaller Houston rival, Dynegy Inc.,= in a deal worth about $9 billion in stock and the assumption of $13 billio=n in debt. The combination of the two companies, energy experts and lawmake=rs said today, poses a novel set of challenges for regulators still struggl=ing to grasp the complexities of the marketplace that Enron invented.=20  We re in a supersonic-speed era of electronic trading with a horse-and-bu=ggy-era regulatory system to protect consumers,   said Representative Edwar=d J. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat who has devised legislation to close =the regulatory gap.=20Dynegy s acquisition of Enron is expected to be reviewed by numerous state =and federal agencies, led by the Justice Department, the Federal Trade Comm=ission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.=20Analysts said today that sharp scrutiny would be given to the combined comp=anies  holdings in California, where Dynegy owns generating plants and Enro=n controls a large part of the market for trading natural gas -- the fuel f=or a big share of the state s electric power plants.=20  Dynegy would now have a greater ability to take the dominant position in =gas and raise the price of electricity,   said Frank Wolak, a professor of =economics at Stanford University.=20Mr. Wolak, a consultant to the Justice Department on a 1999 antitrust case =that led to limits on another merger of electricity and natural gas compani=es in Southern California, said he was skeptical that regulators were up to= the task of reviewing today s deal.=20The transaction   is something the Department of Justice needs to look at, =and they are going to have a hard time looking at,   Mr. Wolak said.   And =it s beyond the ability of the F.E.R.C. to look at.  =20Pat Wood -- named chairman of the federal energy commission earlier this ye=ar with the backing of Kenneth L. Lay, the chairman of Enron -- acknowledge=d in an interview today that the agency had   a long way to go   in matchin=g the sophistication of the companies it regulates.=20But he said that the commission had made great strides in grappling with th=e new risk management techniques pioneered by Enron, Dynegy and other energ=y companies. It is hiring more experts, he said, adopting more restrictive =rules on how much   market power   one party can control and requiring more= disclosure of certain energy transactions.=20In an interview this evening, Charles L. Watson, the chairman of Dynegy, sa=id he did not believe that regulators reviewing the deal with Enron would r=equire the sale of any assets.   We haven t really identified any pitfalls =that require any sort of asset divestiture,   he said.   There s not really= any overlap.  =20A senior executive at one of Enron s largest energy-trading rivals disagree=d.   I don t think this deal gets through unscathed,   he said today.   I m= sure the Justice Department and the F.T.C. will look closely at the pretty= substantial concentration of market power these companies will have in the= energy-trading area.  =20Enron is mainly a trader of natural gas and electricity -- indeed, the bigg=est player in both those markets -- and it also owns a network of gas pipel=ines. Dynegy processes and sells natural gas and generates and sells electr=icity. Each company owns a local electric utility, too: Dynegy owns Illinoi=s Power in Decatur, Ill., while Enron owns Portland General Electric in Por=tland, Ore., but last month announced plans to sell it to another Oregon ut=ility.=20For a decade, as it transformed itself from a gas pipeline operator into th=e nation s biggest energy trader, Enron enjoyed unalloyed lobbying success =in Washington and the enthusiastic backing of Wall Street.=20In the early months of the Bush administration, Mr. Lay -- whose company wa=s one of the biggest financial backers of George W. Bush s presidential cam=paign -- played a prominent, and some said unusual, role in helping the Whi=te House pick nominees to the federal energy commission. Enron executives m=et with Vice President Dick Cheney, whose energy task force backed many of =the deregulatory initiatives pushed by Mr. Lay.=20Now,   the company has become a pariah,   an Enron executive said today.   =The Bush administration doesn t want to have anything to do with us.  =20The problems began with the energy crisis in California, where Enron s outs=poken defense of deregulation, even more than its electricity trading activ=ities, made the company a favorite whipping boy of politicians and consumer= advocates. In the financial markets, meanwhile, Enron s confusing disclosu=res, tolerated when its stock was soaring, drew disdain as the calming of t=he energy storms in California and other parts of the country beat the shar=es down, starting last spring.=20  Enron fell victim to their own inconsistencies on transparency,   Mr. Wol=ak said. As California officials sought to understand why energy prices had= soared out of control, he said, Enron s   view was that we want everybody =s data, but if you want ours, get a subpoena.  =20Energy executives and regulators said that sort of arrogance had long marke=d Enron s attitude about government oversight.=20Electricity sales had for decades been the job of local utility companies, =operating as monopolies and selling power at regulated rates within their s=ervice areas. A few entrepreneurs, led by Mr. Lay, conceived a different mo=del in which power could be sold by generators or middlemen to big corporat=e users or utilities in faraway regions, at whatever price the market would= bear.=20In the early 1990 s, Congress -- under heavy lobbying by Enron -- passed le=gislation that began to open up electricity sales to marketers. Before long=, Enron became one of the first companies to receive government approval to= sell electricity at market rates. The market for interstate sales of natur=al gas had been freed up a few years earlier, and critics complained that t=raders like Enron were gleaning their profits by stoking volatility in gas =prices.=20In the mid-1990 s, independent gas producers backed legislation in Congress= to allow the creation of a co-operative marketing organization, which, the=y hoped, would have helped stabilize prices.=20Raymond Plank, the chairman of the Apache Corporation, a gas producer based= in Houston, said that the big gas marketing and trading companies, includi=ng Enron, successfully lobbied to kill the plan, leaving prices as volatile= as ever.=20  It was a great concept,   Mr. Plank said.   We could have headed off the =problems we have today.  =20Enron s final lobbying success came last year. With a strong push from the =company s lobbyists, Congress passed futures trading legislation that exemp=ted Internet energy trading platforms like EnronOnline, the industry leader=, from oversight by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Enron takes t=he other side of trades on its exchange. In traditional markets like the Ne=w York Mercantile Exchange, which remain subject to oversight, the exchange= acts as a middleman between buyers and sellers.=20Under Mr. Watson, Dynegy has been less of a pathbreaker than Enron, and tho=ugh California politicians denounced it, too, as a profiteer during the ene=rgy crisis, most analysts say it has been less aggressive than Enron in bot=h its business practices and its lobbying.=20Indeed, the rival energy-trading executive today predicted   a huge culture= clash   as the Houston neighbors merge.   Blood will flow in Houston over =the integration of the trading operation,   he said.=20But regulators may find Dynegy easier to deal with.=20Earlier this year, the federal energy commission asked for comments on whet=her it should tighten scrutiny of dealings between natural gas pipelines an=d energy-trading shops owned by the same company.=20Enron wondered what all the bother was.   Would stricter rules prevent real= affiliate abuse that current rules do not,   it wrote in a regulatory fili=ng,   or would they instead merely restrict the activities of some of the m=ore successful participants in the marketplace?  =20Dynegy, by contrast, painted a grim picture and invited regulators to crack= down.   Abuses abound,   it said,   because of financial windfalls, diffic=ulty of detection, lengthy investigations and increased complexity of the m=arket.  Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Any =deeper downgrade would have forced Enron to sell stock to cover about $3.3b=n of obligations, and could have deterred Dynegy.

In 1986, Ken Lay, CEO of Houston Natural gas, w=as named chairman and CEO, and the name ""Enron"" was chosen.

The man who was once referred to as an ""energetic messiah"" has been f=orced to sell off his creation in a fire sale to rival Dynegy in a hastily =arranged deal. Lay s approach is reflected in the design of the building En=ron is constructing across from its existing tower on Smith Street. Looking= down on the massive trading floor are two offices built for Lay and Skilli=ng.=20The offices were considered symbolic of the company s openness and its phil=osophy of melding executives with the rank and file. Lay reportedly spurned= the express elevator to ride to his 50th-floor office to spend more time w=ith employees.=20That sort of hands-on approach Lay brought to the company may be another ca=sualty, analysts said.=20""I would be surprised if he had much of a role in running things from a day=-to-day perspective,"" said Brian Youngberg, energy analyst with Edward Jone=s in St. Louis. ""I think Dynegy will be running the ship and plug in some E=nron executives.""=20As the dust settles on Enron, the question is being raised as to whether th=e company became too big for one or two men to run in a hands-on fashion.==20""Ken Lay helped build Enron from being just a pipeline company, but over ti=me the company got so big and complex that it was too hard for one or two s=enior executives to completely oversee things and to know fully what was go=ing on in the operating companies,"" Youngberg said.=20Raised on a farm in Missouri, Lay is well-known not just as chairman of Enr=on but as a former undersecretary of the Interior Department and one of the= people who has helped shape Houston s destiny in the past 20 years. He is =considered instrumental in keeping Major League Baseball in Houston by supp=orting the construction of Enron Field.=20But his lasting legacy will likely be as one of the key people who helped c=reate the huge natural gas futures market in the United States, which was n=onexistent as recently as the late 1980s. He also will be remembered as the= man who led others to view the energy business as one integrated market an=d not individual fiefdoms.=20""Ken Lay really did educate his peers to understand the broadness of his bu=siness,"" said Amy Jaffe, a senior energy analyst with Rice University s Jam=es A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy. ""Whether his retirement is und=er positive or negative circumstances, he has left a huge legacy on the ind=ustry.""=20Jaffe sees Lay as the person who got oil and gas executives to break out of= the old mentality and explore new technologies such as fuel cells and wind= power. He also was a leading proponent of natural gas and power deregulati=on.=20He will leave Enron a wealthy man, although much less so since the company =s stock nose-dived. His current contract pays him a base salary of $1.4 mil=lion a year and a bonus of $7 million. It was due to expire in December 200=3.=20This is not the first time Lay has had to rescue Enron. In 1987, Enron was =rocked by the disclosure that rogue traders at its Enron Oil Co. had left t=he company holding the bag for about $1 billion in trading liabilities. Bef=ore disclosing it to the market, the company worked the trading loss down t=o about $142 million.=20""We learned a lot, certainly in a bad way,"" Lay said of the incident in an =interview earlier this year. ""We put in place probably the best risk manage=ment and control system, not just in our business, but in any industry.""=20Some see irony in the fact that Dynegy CEO Chuck Watson will likely prevail= over Lay despite Lay s almost cult status among business leaders and busin=ess school professors.=20""Chuck Watson was underrated in his role in forming the natural gas market =in the United States. He was the man who realized the enormous potential of= the natural gas market,"" Jaffe said. ""It s true that Enron came in with a =lot of advertising and built up a big position, but maybe there is some poe=tic justice that the man who really started the natural gas clearinghouse c=ould wind back up as the dominant player in the industry.""=20...=20THE PLAYERS=201985-present: Enron Corp., various top management posts, currently chairman= and CEO 1984-1985: Houston Natural Gas Corp., chairman and CEO 1981-1984 T=ransco Energy Co., president and chief operating officer Board memberships:= Compaq Computer Corp., Eli Lilly & Co. and Trust Company of the West Educa=tion: University of Missouri, master s degree, economics, 1965: doctorate, =economics, Membership: Energy Advisory Board secretary; National Petroleum =Council memberPhoto: Ken Lay=20Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

""Chuck s not all caught up in the Houston hustle-and-bustle thing.""==20Like it or not, Watson is about to step out in a big way. If Dynegy complet=es the acquisition of Enron for $8.85 billion in stock, Watson will become =captain of Houston s largest company. He will step right into the center of= the city s business stage, taking from Enron Chairman Ken Lay the mantle o=f most powerful businessman in a city where commerce and the deal have alwa=ys come first.=20Those who know Watson say he should have little trouble adapting to his hig=her profile and is ready for the many demands that will inexorably follow.==20""Chuck is a guy who knows what he wants and goes and gets it,"" Fertitta sai=d. ""He is not intimidated.""=20In fact, when longtime friend Steve Patterson read about Enron s nose-dive =and the collapse of its stock, he instinctively knew Watson would close in =on a deal.=20""I thought: `You know what, Chuck will try to buy Enron. It just fits. It s= the big bold move that Chuck would try to make,  "" said Patterson, senior =vice president of the Houston Texans football team. Watson owns 15 percent =of the Texans, the largest chunk outside of the piece owned by club founder= Bob McNair. Watson also owns the Houston Aeros hockey team.=20Like Enron Chairman Ken Lay, Watson was a pioneer in the deregulation of th=e energy business. He was one of the early innovative forces that shaped th=e world of trading electricity and swapping natural gas.=20Watson was born 51 years ago on the Great Lakes naval base north of Chicago=. His father worked for the Navy, which moved the young Watson clan around =early and often. Chuck Watson had attended more than 20 schools in nine sta=tes when he graduated from Oklahoma State University in 1972 with a degree =in economics.=20After a 13-year career at Conoco, Watson joined a fledgling company called =U.S. Natural Gas Clearinghouse in 1985. NGC was a consortium of gas pipelin=es that had the backing of a financial- services company and a local law fi=rm, but conflicts among the partners hamstrung the little company.=20Watson would not join the company until it was overhauled and most of the q=uarreling partners were bought out. Watson s vision was to buy the gas and =take title to it, aggregate big volumes and leverage that to make bigger de=als and negotiate better rates from the pipelines that moved the gas around=.=20In short, the company moved beyond being a broker and became a wholesale st=ore for natural gas.=20""He is a visionary in the energy business,"" said Bob McNair, a longtime fri=end who founded Cogen Technologies and later sold the company to Enron for =$1.1 billion. ""Chuck will come across as this relaxed, country person. Not =some sophisticate. But that is disarming. He is very creative, and he is ve=ry smart.""=20While NGC initially concentrated on gathering, moving and trading natural g=as, the business has broadened along with the quickening pace of energy der=egulation. Now called Dynegy, short for Dynamic Energy, the company has evo=lved into an outfit that sells power directly to commercial and industrial =users of electricity and natural gas. It also has built a communications di=vision to capitalize on increasing demand for high-speed communication serv=ices.=20Last year the company recorded an astounding 230 percent rise in net income=, as well as a 91 percent jump in operating revenues. Dynegy s stock climbe=d 218 percent last year.=20""The success of Dynegy is a tremendous story,"" Patterson said. ""It is amazi=ng the growth and the value he has been able to achieve.""=20According to some of those who ve have done business with him, Watson is no=t just bright, he is extraordinarily tough.=20""He is a very aggressive person, a tough negotiator. He bores in,"" said Geo=rge Mitchell, founder of Mitchell Energy and the man who carved The Woodlan=ds out of the piney forest.""He is a very confident person. Unlike Ken Lay, =who is a smoother type personality who works with people, Watson is going t=o do it his way. They are both very good business people, but they are very= different.""=20While willing to give power to his subordinates, Watson is a hands- on CEO =who is unmistakably Dynegy s commanding force.=20""Chuck is very, very intense . . . He burns,"" said former Houston Mayor Bob= Lanier. ""In negotiations, he gets down and learns all the details himself.=""=20How tough Watson is willing to be came to light in his contentious dealings= with Houston Rockets owner Les Alexander. Watson owned the master lease to= the Summit, later renamed the Compaq Center, which committed the Rockets t=o playing there through 2003. Eager to break the deal, Alexander tried nego=tiating and litigating his way out of the lease, all to no avail.=20The battle deepened as the two men competed unsuccessfully to get a NHL hoc=key team in Houston and feuded over how a hockey team would share in the re=venues of a new stadium proposed for downtown.=20Angered at the deal Alexander was able to get for the Rockets, at the expen=se of a hockey franchise, Watson spent about $100,000 out of his own pocket= to help defeat the stadium referendum. It was his one overtly political ac=t here, and some say it was the decisive blow to Alexander s aspirations.==20""There are a lot of people I d much rather have a contest with,"" Lanier sai=d of Watson.=20Alexander and Watson were later able to settle their differences, and Watso=n supported the second arena referendum, which passed. A basketball arena i=s now under construction downtown.=20""I m not surprised to see Chuck Watson make an aggressive move like this,"" =Alexander said Friday evening. ""He understands the industry as well as anyo=ne; and therefore, he s in the best position to assess the risk and take ad=vantage of the opportunity.""=20Like most opportunities, the deal also represents a sizable risk. Taking ov=er Enron is a huge reach for Dynegy, which will try to swallow a company th=at was five times bigger when measured by revenues.=20Watson will need all of his shrewdness and ferocity to untangle the mess th=at is Enron and merge two operations that were each, in their own way, tryi=ng to reinvent the energy business.=20""I have some concerns for my friend,"" McNair confessed.

But the culpability of Enron s current or former employe=es, if any, won t be clear for some time.=20On Oct. 17, the day after Enron reported an unexpected third- quarter loss,= the SEC began asking Enron questions about two off- balance-sheet partners=hips, called LJM1 and LJM2. They were formed to help the company grow witho=ut adding additional debt or diluting stock valuations, and were also used =to help hedge against the risks in some of Enron s newer lines of business.==20Former CFO Andy Fastow formed the partnerships with the approval of the com=pany s board of directors, attorneys and auditors. His dual role as CFO and= managing partner of those two partnerships had the appearance of a conflic=t of interest, even though Enron insisted that measures were taken to preve=nt any illegal or unethical behavior.=20The SEC s role in looking at the partnerships isn t to prevent company exec=utives from having conflicts of interest in their dealings, however, but ra=ther to make sure the companies fully disclose those conflicts or any situa=tions that may appear to be conflicts, said John Coates, a professor at Har=vard Law school.=20""So although they have a role in determining that all the information in En=ron s proxy was correct and that all transactions were reported, they were =not responsible for determining whether or not the transactions were done o=n fair terms,"" Coates said.=20Item 404 of SEC Regulation S-K requires companies to disclose any transacti=ons where executive officers personally benefit by $60,000 or more. That di=sclosure should include their direct and indirect interests in the deal, th=e amount of money or assets they receive through it and other information.==20As in all rules, however, there are certain exceptions.=20If an executive s compensation from a deal is less than 10 percent of the v=alue of the overall transaction, they may not need to disclose all of those= details, Coates said. That stipulation could possible give Enron cover for= not having previously disclosed the $30 million Fastow earned through the =partnerships.=20""But there are times when the companies may have followed the letter of the= rules and the SEC still pushes them to fully disclose the details,"" he sai=d.=20Whether or not Enron needed to disclose previously the investments or profi=ts that a number of other employees made in some of the partnerships is als=o hard to discern.=20The company said this week that in addition to Fastow, five other employees= invested in the deals. Two of those employees - Ben Glisan, a managing dir=ector and treasurer of Enron Corp., and Kristina Mordaunt, a managing direc=tor and general counsel of an Enron division - were terminated by Enron thi=s week. The other employees, including Fastow and executives Michael Kopper=, Kathy Lynn and Anne Yeager, no longer work for Enron.=20The company didn t mention how much those individuals invested or how much =benefit, if any, they reaped from the deals. Some of the employees may not =even fall under the disclosure rule since it doesn t give a clear definitio=n of what positions are ""executive officers.""=20The company has gradually distanced itself from Fastow and the partnerships= since the problems arose. Shortly after the earnings report last month Lay= said he and the board stood by Fastow, but a day later replaced him.=20On Oct. 31, the day Enron said the SEC had upgraded its review of the finan=ces from a simple inquiry to a formal investigation, the company announced =that its board of directors had created a special investigation committee o=f its own. A company spokeswoman stressed that the committee had the power =to take disciplinary action against any Enron employee, officer or director= who it determines ""improperly participated in the transactions.""=20In its SEC filing that outlined the partnerships on Thursday, the company s=aid it was aware of the partnerships but required that certain safeguards b=e put in place and that the transactions be approved and reviewed regularly=.=20""Whether these controls and procedures were properly implemented is a subje=ct of the Special Committee s investigation,"" the statement said.=20At a Friday news conference, Lay said the board was aware of the formation =of one of the partnerships but that he was not aware that Glisan and Mordau=nt were investing in the partnerships. Lay deflected many of the questions =regarding the investigation, saying a conference call would be held next we=ek.=20Shareholders have lined up behind lawsuits against the company, the partner=ships, and even the company s law firm, Vinson & Elkins.=20""Disclosure cases and state corporate law cases are all but assured in situ=ations like this,"" Coates said.

Six months later, Enron was fighting for its life. In a $7.8 billion sto=ck deal struck Friday, Enron will cease to exist as its operations are fold=ed into rival Houston energy firm Dynegy.=20Enron, in recent years one of Houston s most important corporations, did no=t reach this pass because its ambitions were too high. Unlike the mythical =Icarus, Enron did not fly too near the sun, melting the wax of its wings.Enron s troubles came because some of its top executives chose to do much o=f their piloting under cover of darkness. In the process, they lost their w=ay.=20By using several mysterious partnerships to finance projects and shield ris=k and debt from public scrutiny, Enron s leaders set the stage for the vici=ous circle in which drops in earnings and investor confidence and creditwor=thiness followed and exacerbated one another. The deals became so complicat=ed and impenetrable that Enron s directors, who approved them, no longer kn=ew whether the company s revenues and assets were coming or going.=20The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating Enron s financial a=rrangements and questionable bookkeeping, and an Enron spokesman says the c=ompany now finds it difficult to know the state of the partnerships it owne=d or controlled. Following months during which Enron s announcements regard=ing departing executives lacked both accuracy and candor, the company this =past week restated its finances back to 1997, subtracting $586 million from= its net income and adding $2.5 billion to its debt. Regardless of what the= SEC inquiry finds, Enron s revised accounting makes a good case for congre=ssional or regulatory elimination of whatever loopholes allowed Enron to in=flate its income and obscure its debt.=20Enron officials say a special board committee is investigating the financia=l arrangements between former Enron executives and the obscure investment p=artnerships they managed or controlled. An Enron spokesman said the committ=ee would make public its findings ""at an appropriate time."" The appropriate=ness of that time diminishes the further it gets from the present.=20Neither Enron officials nor investors need to wait for the committee s repo=rt to conclude that letting executives profit on the side from the partners=hips while sticking stockholders with the liabilities was inappropriate. Fo=r the sake of Enron, its stockholders and the citizens of Houston, who depe=nd on Enron s contribution to the economy and the civic life of the city, t=hat arrangement must not be repeated.=20Much of Enron s problems stem from straightforward but imprudent or ill-tim=ed investments: a power plant in India, broadband capacity not needed in a =collapsing telecommunications market, and a doomed venture into the water b=usiness - Azurix Corp.=20Those losses might have been survivable, had Enron not denied its own trans=actions the transparency it sought for global energy markets.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Though several states have delayed their deregulation plan=s and some major corporate players are tempering their enthusiasm, other st=ates and corporations press ahead.=20It s a tough new world for energy companies that will bring profit opportun=ities for some and acquisitions of low-priced players, analysts say. Enron,= once the most brash of the energy peddlers, has agreed to be acquired by a=rchrival Dynegy Inc. in a $7.7-billion stock deal.=20Yet when the economy and power prices improve, energy companies will see th=eir prospects gleam again, analysts say.=20""Deregulation is a train that s not going to be derailed. It may be delayed=, but it s coming,"" said Jon Kyle Cartwright, senior energy analyst with br=okerage firm Raymond James & Associates.=20""When the economy rebounds, we re going to see higher energy prices again,""= Cartwright said. ""That means that the guys who sell power, the guys who ma=nufacture power--they re going to have very bright futures.""=20Less than a year ago, when energy prices were headed for record territory i=n California and a winter of electricity shortages plagued the state, the f=avorite whipping boys of Gov. Gray Davis and other politicians were such en=ergy sellers as Enron, AES Corp., Dynegy, Duke Energy Corp., Reliant Energy= Inc., Mirant Corp., Williams Cos. and El Paso Corp.=20All are energy companies that own power plants in California or sell electr=icity or natural gas in the state at prices deemed by state officials to be= higher than those a truly competitive market would have produced. The ener=gy companies have denied that they overcharged Californians, and federal re=gulators investigating the matter have so far ordered only limited refunds =of electricity revenues.=20Nonetheless, Southern California Edison Co. and Pacific Gas & Electric Co. =lost so much money paying for electricity--costs they could not pass on to =customers because of a rate freeze--that they became insolvent. PG&E filed =for bankruptcy protection.=20California s near-death experience in electricity markets brought state gov=ernment into the power business in unanticipated ways when lawmakers passed= the landmark deregulation bill in 1996.=20The state became the primary electricity buyer for the big utilities  custo=mers and formed a power authority to build power plants and transmission li=nes, becoming potential competition to generation companies. State regulato=rs blocked electricity sellers from signing up new retail customers, a prog=ram known as ""direct access"" that is one of the key components of electrici=ty deregulation.=20Players Refocusing on Other Operations=20The energy spectacle in California caused several states to short-circuit d=eregulation plans or to take a much slower approach that could delay for ye=ars the opening of those markets to competition.=20Energy companies also are now contending with lower electricity prices, whi=ch have plummeted since the beginning of the year, thanks to lower natural =gas prices and temperate weather. And volatility has nearly disappeared, th=ereby cutting profit potential for energy trading firms.=20The economic downturn will reduce demand for electricity, analysts said, wh=ich also will hurt earnings at a range of companies.=20The pain was apparent in third-quarter results.=20""After several quarters of across-the-board strong results, we are now in m=ore of a winners-and-losers environment, as low commodity prices and a weak= economy make conditions more difficult,"" Merrill Lynch energy analyst Stev=en Fleishman said in a recent note to clients.=20Some big and mid-size players have stumbled, and a few have slowed their he=adlong rush into unregulated businesses that had until recently held promis=e for these companies, many of them utilities that branched out.=20A prime example is AES, which generates electricity in California, across t=he nation and in 26 other countries. AES said third-quarter net income fell= 98% because of a sharp drop in profit from its operations in Brazil and Br=itain. AES reduced its earnings estimates for the year and said it will ref=ocus on its core energy business, look for divestiture opportunities and no=t invest in any more telecommunications businesses, dropping its hostile $1=.37-billion bid last week to take over a Venezuelan telecom firm.=20Reliant Energy said its wholesale energy operation had a 15% drop in third-=quarter operating income, blaming lower gas and power prices, plus legal an=d other costs related to the California electricity crisis. The company s E=uropean operations lost $5 million because of lower profit brought about by= deregulation in the Netherlands, and Reliant now is considering selling it=s European businesses.=20Constellation Energy Group, which owns the utility in Baltimore and is buil=ding power plants in California and around the country, abandoned plans to =spin off its trading operation after it said earnings for the year will com=e in at the low end of estimates.=20One California firm that appeared poised to benefit from electricity shorta=ges was Chatsworth-based Capstone Turbine Corp., which manufactures micro-t=urbines that supply power to a small business or a cluster of homes.=20But struggling Capstone said third-quarter revenue dropped by nearly half a=nd its net loss widened by 54% to $12.5 million as California dodged a summ=er of blackouts and the economy slowed.=20Energy Giant Takes an Unexpected Loss=20The company hired a new chief operating officer and said it would restructu=re and lay off an undisclosed number of employees.=20The biggest surprise came from Enron, which broke a run of 16 profitable qu=arters, reporting a $635-million net loss for the third quarter because of =a $1-billion charge from failed investments in water and telecommunications=. The Houston-based energy giant also revealed that two of its off-balance-=sheet investment partnerships, headed until July by its chief financial off=icer, led to $35million of the losses and chipped $1.2billion off sharehold=er equity in the third quarter.=20Investors began this month to dump the stock, and Enron s credit rating ero=ded amid lawsuits, news of a probe by the Securities and Exchange Commissio=n into conflicts of interest and attempts by management to soothe fears.=20Enron Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, who ran the two partnerships, =was pushed out and the firm lined up new financing and went looking for new= investors.=20Enron has used an opaque grid of off-balance-sheet partnerships to shelter =assets and debt to help the company s push into a variety of deregulated ma=rkets in recent years. But analysts and investors fear that Enron is hiding= money-losing assets in the partnerships; management has been tight-lipped =about the purpose and holdings of the investment vehicles.=20Takeover rumors swirled last week around Enron before Dynegy announced the =deal Friday, underscoring predictions of general industry consolidation bec=ause of low stock prices.=20Some Firms Thriving, but Not Their Stocks=20Some companies are still going strong, although their stocks remain depress=ed.=20That includes companies on the receiving end of potshots from California s =politicians and utility regulators such as Duke Energy, Dynegy, Mirant, NRG= Corp. and Williams, as well as San Jose-based Calpine Corp., which was rep=eatedly praised by Davis for playing a constructive role during the crisis.==20Calpine, for instance, said third-quarter profit and revenue doubled becaus=e the electricity producer increased sales by adding power plants. And yet =its stock is down 55% from a 52-week high of $58 reached in March.=20""These are the energy merchants that seem to have the best grasp on the mar=ket and on risk management,"" said Chris Ellinghaus, power and natural gas a=nalyst with Williams Capital in New York. Many of these companies are diver=sified geographically and by the fuel they use to generate electricity and =had locked in favorable contracts that protected them when power prices fel=l this summer, he said.=20ABN Amro utility analyst Paul Patterson said investors have turned away fro=m these companies, even the healthy ones, because the business ""isn t as ex=citing as it used to be.""=20""People go on earnings momentum. It s kind of like having your dessert firs=t,"" Patterson said. ""Once the best is over, you lose your appetite.""=20One company trying to adapt to deregulation s devolution in California is C=ommonwealth Energy Corp., which has survived a run-in with the California P=ublic Utilities Commission and the suspension in California of direct acces=s, Commonwealth s primary business of selling electricity directly to consu=mers and businesses.=20Commonwealth Energy was one of the more than 300 companies that flocked to =California to sell retail electricity to the customers of Southern Californ=ia Edison, PG&E and San Diego Gas & Electric Co. All but about a dozen of t=he electricity sellers failed, and Commonwealth enjoyed initial success ped=dling low-priced power from renewable sources.=20But the Tustin-based company and its founder, Fred Bloom, ran afoul of the =PUC for faulty billing practices and Bloom s failure to disclose that he ha=d been ordered to stop selling unregistered securities by five states.=20Commonwealth Energy settled the matter by paying about $350,000 and reimbur=sing customers. Bloom was banished from the firm as part of the settlement,= and an all-new management team set about diversifying away from deregulate=d businesses, said Ian Carter, the company s chairman and chief executive.==20The firm, which recently became registered as a public company but can t se=ll stock until January, is earning a profit, largely because it has been ab=le to resell contracted energy for more than it paid.=20To maintain its growth, the company is turning away from deregulation and t=oward providing back-office services for regulated companies, generators an=d municipalities, Carter said.=20For the fiscal year ended July 31, Commonwealth Energy posted revenue of $1=83 million, up 84%, and income of $60.5 million, compared with a loss of $8=.6 million in the previous fiscal year.=20""We certainly don t consider ourselves a casualty of deregulation or direct= access,"" Carter said, noting that the company still sells electricity to 5=5,000 California business and residential customers and to cities, includin=g Santa Monica and Palmdale.=20""We realized that we needed to diversify and we needed to do that fairly qu=ickly,"" Carter said. The company has nearly 40,000 retail customers in Penn=sylvania and will be entering Texas, Michigan, New Jersey and Ohio, he said=.=20Seven states have delayed their push toward open markets, and some of those= that remain on track, such as Texas, have run into unforeseen glitches tha=t delay the process of giving electricity customers choices beyond their tr=aditional utilities.=20Deregulation marches on in power trading and generation.=20The Electric Power Supply Assn., a Washington-based trade group, said last =week that competitive power supplies account for slightly more than a third= of the nation s generation capacity, up from 8.5% in 1997. Wholesale power= trading could approach 7 billion megawatt-hours this year, up from 2.6 bil=lion in 1999, the group said.=20Federal regulators are in the middle of determining how to reallocate contr=ol of electricity transmission lines into only a few regional operators, pe=rhaps owned by new for-profit companies other than utilities.=20This process shows that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission remains de=termined to open electricity markets despite the problems in California, sa=id Lawrence J. Makovich, senior director of the North American power practi=ce at Cambridge Energy Research Associates.=20""We ve got major parts of the electricity business moving backward, and Cal=ifornia is the prime example,"" Makovich said. ""But when you look at other p=laces in the country, what you see is a continuing evolution to a much more= market-based power situation.""=20David Jermain, a principal in the national utility practice of Andersen LLP=, said California will remain on the sidelines for years, paying higher pri=ces than those produced by competitive markets.

As far as US fund managers are concerned, this is a comp=any that let Wall Street down spectacularly. Dynergy is thought to have wai=ted until then to be sure Moody s did not downgrade Enron s investment grad=e to junk status.The misery is doubled by the tempting image of what Enron could have been. =At their peak almost a year ago, the shares gave the company a market value= of $69bn; on Friday they were worth a tenth of that.=20The market felt there was good reason to push the stock to those heights. H=ere was a company that had, for many years, appeared to make all the right =moves. As the group transformed itself from a dull utility into an exciting= mix of energy trading, communications and services, it seemed never to put= a foot wrong. ""You had such an outstanding and arrogant company,"" said Rog=er Hamilton, a senior fund manager at John Hancock, ""They were the giant. E=verything in the energy industry touched Enron.""=20The company even managed to persuade investors its convoluted management st=ructure, which some believe is the root cause of its demise, was a positive= thing. ""You can t kiss the ass of 24 people,"" said former Enron chairman J=effrey Skilling. ""And together those 24 people are more likely to have the =interests of the shareholders at heart than any one person.""=20Unfortunately, behind the scenes, all hell was breaking loose. The last cou=ple of months have given the market a long, embarrassing string of revelati=ons about the company it once cherished. The company has $13bn of outstandi=ng debt, and has found its access to funds extremely limited. Two weeks ago=, as a measure of its desperation, Enron had to secure a rescue loan agains=t its 25,000- mile network of gas pipelines. Along the way, details of the =group s botched expansion into India have made for supremely depressing ref=lections on management. Crowning the whole sorry tale, and driving the shar=es down 80 per cent, was the opening last month of a Securities and Exchang=e Commission probe into the accounting for some of Enron s partnerships. La=st week came the sacking of the group s treasurer and corporate lawyer, and= a revision of earnings for the last four years to the tune of half-a-billi=on dollars.=20Despite it all, Dynergy s bid could be the steal of the century. Until all =its troubles are out in the open, Enron may be just a little too grimy for =many potential buyers.

EmshwillerStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal11/13/2001The Wall Street JournalA4(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)The shares of Enron Corp. and Dynegy Inc. both rose in heavy trading as investors began trying to digest the possible risks and rewards of Dynegy s plan to acquire Enron in a stock swap with a current value of $10.12 billion. In calls and meetings with analysts yesterday, Dynegy Chairman Chuck Watson and Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay continued talking up the deal that was announced late Friday. ""We are confident this is good strategically and financially for Dynegy and Enron,"" said Mr. Watson, who will serve as chairman and chief executive of the combined entity, to be called Dynegy Inc.While the proposed combination faces months of review by government agencies and gives Dynegy possible opportunities to cancel the deal, investors  initial reaction to the merger announcement was positive. As of 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Dynegy shares were at $44.31, up $5.55, or 14%. Also on the Big Board, Enron was at $9.24, up 7.1%, or 61 cents. Both companies were among the most actively traded issues. Under terms of the proposed acquisition, Dynegy would give 0.2685 of its shares for each Enron share. Based on Dynegy s stock price yesterday , this formula values Enron stock at $11.90 each. Enron has about 850 million shares outstanding. Some people raised cautionary notes yesterday. Moody s Investors Service placed Dynegy on review for a possible credit-ratings downgrade. Standard & Poor s made a similar move on Friday. Moody s said that while it saw positive elements to the proposed combination, it also believed ""the financial and business risks associated with the transaction could negatively impact Dynegy s credit fundamentals."" Prudential Securities analyst Carol Coale, who counts herself a fan of Dynegy, also worries that Enron s enormous problems could be a drag on the combined entity. ""I don t want the Dynegy folks to get into something that s not good for the company,"" she said. As reported, Enron in the past several weeks has seen its stock price and standing in the investment community plummet, largely as the result of large-scale transactions it did with partnerships headed by Enron officers. Those transactions have produced hundreds of millions of dollars of write-offs and restatements in the past month. They are being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission and have helped spawn more than a dozen shareholder lawsuits.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 	Business/Financial Desk; Section CMarket PlaceGas Pipeline Is Prominent As Dynegy Seeks EnronBy FLOYD NORRIS11/13/2001The New York TimesPage 1, Column 5c. 2001 New York Times CompanyDynegy has negotiated a great takeover. And it may end up buying Enron, too. As part of its planned acquisition of Enron, Dynegy will get the crown jewel even if the overall deal falls apart. In return for its $1.5 billion investment today, Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern Natural Gas, a pipeline system that is probably worth more.As Dynegy stock soared 14 percent yesterday, Enron s lagged behind, rising just 7 percent. [Page C13.] That widened the spread -- the profit a trader could lock in by buying Enron and selling Dynegy short, assuming the deal goes through -- to 28 percent. The big premium probably reflects more than the fact that this deal will not close for many months. It is at least a possibility that Dynegy will renegotiate the price, or even walk away, as it learns more about Enron s business. Not that Chuck Watson, chairman and chief executive of Dynegy, was threatening to do any such thing. In a talk to analysts yesterday, and in a later interview, he was extraordinarily upbeat about Enron s trading business even as he dismissed many of the company s diversifications as failures whose poor performance might have been obscured by fancy accounting. Full details of the agreement between the companies will not be known until the merger agreement is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission today or tomorrow. But it appears that if the agreement falls apart for any reason, Dynegy has the right to keep the pipeline without putting up any additional cash. Speaking to analysts yesterday, Rob Doty, chief financial officer at Dynegy, said the company was paying about seven or eight times the cash flow of the pipeline business. Walking away from the deal might cost Dynegy $350 million if it could not cite any material adverse change in Enron s business, as provided in the merger agreement. But one way to look at this deal is that Dynegy is spending $1.85 billion for the pipeline and a right to get the rest of Enron on the agreed terms. Mr. Watson said he was confident that things would not go wrong.   We have comfort there is not another shoe to drop,   he said.   If there is no shoe, this is a phenomenally good transaction.   In presentations to analysts, Dynegy officials said they expected the company s earnings per share to grow by at least 90 cents a year even before considering cost reductions as the two businesses are merged. That arithmetic was based on assumptions that Enron could deliver at least 75 percent of the $2 a share in pro-forma earnings that Wall Street had been forecasting for next year. Those forecasts had stayed the same even as Enron s business collapsed. The bullish case for the merger is that Enron s real profits were there and that the financial maneuvering did not cover up far deeper problems. Mr. Watson promised that more details would be disclosed about the partnerships that were created by Enron and traded with it, providing a substantial part of the company s profits in 2000. Enron s need to make a deal quickly -- almost any deal -- was emphasized by Standard & Poor s, the bond rating service. In a conference call yesterday, Ron Barone, an analyst with S.& P., said that without the takeover, Enron s rating would have been cut to low BB or high B. Those ratings are not even at the high end of junk, and a company like Enron, which depends on others being willing to treat it as a trusted trading partner, needs an investment grade rating. Its current S.& P. rating is BBB minus, the lowest investment grade rating. That means Enron could not continue as an independent business. And it means that should Dynegy decide to renegotiate, Enron would be in a very poor bargaining position unless it had another bidder.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 	Business/Financial Desk; Section CTHE MARKETSSuitor for Enron Receives Approval From Wall St.By ALEX BERENSON11/13/2001The New York TimesPage 13, Column 1c. 2001 New York Times CompanyWall Street found nothing but good news in Dynegy s $9 billion takeover of the Enron Corporation yesterday. Three days after Dynegy, an energy marketing and trading company based in Houston, agreed to take over Enron, its giant crosstown rival, Dynegy executives came to New York to assure investors that the deal would sharply increase their company s profits. They met a receptive audience.Dynegy stock closed yesterday at $44.31, up $5.55, or 14.3 percent. Since last Wednesday, when news of a possible takeover emerged, Dynegy s stock has risen more than one-third. Enron closed at $9.24, up 61 cents, or 7.1 percent. After some initial uncertainty about the takeover, investors appear to have accepted Dynegy s view that the deal will give it a lucrative franchise in trading natural gas and electricity. Enron s stock fell almost 80 percent in the weeks leading up to the deal as Enron said it had overstated its earnings by almost $600 million since 1997 and forced out several top executives. But Chuck Watson, Dynegy s chairman, told investors repeatedly yesterday that Enron s problems were mainly a result of failed expansion efforts. He largely dismissed the concerns of some short-sellers and analysts that Enron might be hiding losses at its core energy trading operations.   There s nothing wrong with Enron s business,   Mr. Watson said in an interview at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel after making a lunchtime presentation to analysts and investors.   The people in it ought to be really upset that for the last several years, they have produced earnings and cash that have been invested in other businesses that are not making money.   Enron s immediate problem was a crisis of confidence, which could have caused other companies to stop trading with it, Mr. Watson said. A $1.5 billion cash infusion from Dynegy should restore the confidence of Enron s business partners and keep Enron stable until the takeover is complete, he said. To bolster Enron further, J. P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup may each invest an additional $250 million, executives close to the deal said. The potential investments by J. P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup were reported yesterday in The Wall Street Journal. Mr. Watson said Dynegy would also move quickly to assuage Enron employees who are angry that Kenneth L. Lay, Enron s chairman, and other top executives sold hundreds of millions of dollars in stock in 2000 and this year as Enron s shares plunged.   Right now, there s some animosity over there,   he said. Many employees at Enron will get new grants of stock options when the acquisition is completed, he said. The company said it expected the deal to close by the end of the third quarter of next year, after extensive reviews from federal and state energy regulators and the Department of Justice. Mr. Watson predicted that the deal would lift Dynegy s earnings by 90 cents or more a share next year, to more than $3.45 a share. Analysts backed that view yesterday.   Investments in noncore business distracted the attention of management and also took up capital,   said Thomas Hamlin, an analyst at Wachovia Securities. Mr. Hamlin said he believed that Dynegy had obtained Enron, which reported more than $100 billion in revenue last year, for a bargain price.   It s not too often you get to take out the No. 7 Fortune 500 company and double your earnings in the meantime,   he said.   My guess is the stock is worth $70 per share.   The deal could increase Dynegy s earnings by $1 to $2 a share next year, said Christopher Ellinghaus, an analyst at the Williams Capital Group.   That s a whopper,   he said.   It s a very good deal financially, certainly should be a good deal strategically, and provides some immediate balance-sheet backstop for Enron.   Mr. Lay said in an interview that Enron had been forced to sell itself because of   the relentlessness of all the articles and the shorts.     We realized that we needed to do something to stabilize the ship,   he said.   A good company was being badly tarnished.

Nov. 13, 2001Houston ChronicleShare boost for Dynegy good news Saving Enron trading called key handicap By LAURA GOLDBERG and DAVID IVANOVICH Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle Although investors Monday cheered Dynegy s planned acquisition of Enron Corp., Dynegy must still negotiate a series of potential roadblocks to pull off a successful merger. Among them: ensuring that Enron s core energy-trading business, suffering before the merger announcement, stays healthy. Negative news on that front quickly surfaced Monday as at least two traders said they still plan extremely limited business with Enron. Dynegy must also manage any unexpected disclosures about Enron s financial performance and investment partnerships, convince Enron s traders and other key employees to stick around, and mesh different corporate cultures. Investors were optimistic in Dynegy s abilities as shares in the company traded up $5.55 to close at $44.31 Monday, while shares in Enron ended the day up 61 cents at $9.24. Enron has been under siege since Oct. 16 when it reported a $35 million loss and $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity tied to business dealings with investment partnerships run by its then-chief financial officer. Since then, the Securities and Exchange Commission started an investigation of Enron, a slew of shareholder lawsuits were filed and Enron s stock price plummeted. A new shareholder suit filed Monday included Dynegy on its list of defendants. Last week, Enron said it was restating its earnings back to 1997 to include losses related to a number of complex partnerships, including several being investigated by the SEC. It said it was correcting almost $600 million worth of mistakes. Just how close Enron was to a collapse remains unclear. One industry source believes Enron had been pushed ""to the brink"" and would have been done for if it had been unable to reach agreement with Dynegy last week. But Ron Barone, a credit analyst with Standard & Poor s, doesn t think Enron s condition was so desperate. ""We clearly didn t see this as an imminent bankruptcy or imminent default, but it is something that could have eroded over time ... in a fairly short time."" Friday, Enron s long-term debt rating was downgraded to one notch above investment-grade status by both Moody s Investors Service and S&P. Enron is the largest natural gas and electricity trader in the nation, accounting for about 25 percent of all transactions. Its collapse would have meant the loss of much liquidity in the trading market, making trades more difficult and prices more volatile, industry experts said. Dynegy announced a deal Friday to buy Enron at a fire-sale price of almost $9 billion in stock, plus the assumption of about $13 billion in debt and $2 billion in preferred stock. The merger is expected to close, barring holdups from regulators, in six to nine months. As part of the agreement, Dynegy stakeholder ChevronTexaco is giving Dynegy $1.5 billion, which is to be infused today to help shore up Enron s liquidity and preserve its trading franchise. Some of Enron s former trading partners are still steering clear of the giant. To facilitate transactions, the various energy trading firms extend credit to one another. Those agreements are contingent upon a partner maintaining an adequate rating. If the credit rating firms had downgraded Enron s debt to junk status, its trading operation would have been devastated, industry officials said. As details of Enron s questionable financial dealings have been revealed, Enron s trading partners have been scrambling to reduce their exposure. Kansas City, Mo.-based Aquila Energy Marketing Corp., for instance, has been ratcheting down its activity with Enron, company spokesman Al Butkus said. By the end of last week, Aquila s exposure to Enron was ""insignificant,"" Butkus said. ""And after all that was revealed on Friday and the downgrading of the credit, we are now at an even lower level."" Atlanta-based Mirant has likewise reduced its exposure and is only doing a limited amount of business with Enron. Some larger players, however, continue doing deals with the company. ""Reliant Energy has consistently been trading with Enron through its difficulties, albeit with a heightened sense of caution,"" said Shahid Malik, president of Houston-based Reliant Energy s trading operation. Charlotte, N.C.-based Duke Energy s exposure stands at $100 million. ""We re continuing the way we have been,"" said Duke spokesman Terry Francisco. John Olson, an analyst with Sanders Morris Harris in Houston, predicted it would take the traders some time to digest the merger deal. ""I think people will increasingly come back to Enron just as soon as the $1.5 billion changes hands,"" he said. Traders still have incentives to do business with Enron even though it s being sold, as it has a wider variety of products than some of its competitors and its EnronOnline Internet trading operation is regarded as superior. On a conference call with investors and analysts Monday morning, Dynegy and Enron executives fielded a variety of questions about the merger but refused comment on a Wall Street Journal report that J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup are considering a $500 million investment in Enron. Analysts remain worried that new and troubling surprises will emerge about Enron s finances, including those that could call into question whether its core trading business is as advertised. Dynegy executives aren t expecting any such disclosures, but took a conservative approach to calculating merger benefits. ""I believe we have adequately bracketed the downside,"" said Chuck Watson, Dynegy s chairman and chief executive. Even with a worst-case scenario, Dynegy still found a ""tremendous amount of economic value"" in the merger, said Watson, who will take the same roles after the merger. The deal, Dynegy said, will add 90 cents to 95 cents per share in earnings for current Dynegy shareholders. And that s before cost savings that are expected to run $400 million to $500 million a year. Dynegy detailed two escape clauses in the merger deal. For one, if the amount of legal and shareholder claims Enron must pay out is greater than $3.5 billion, it can be called off. Enron and Dynegy officials also said they will do whatever it takes to keep their key people. But will traders jump ship? ""Oh, yeah I m sure they will,"" the industry source said. Jeff Dietert, an analyst with Simmons & Co. International in Houston, believes that a number of Enron s marketers and traders will find Dynegy a strong alternative. ""I firmly believe that the Enron guys like to play on the winning team and Dynegy is a very, very strong player,"" he said. That Dynegy was approached by three key Enron executives about a merger showed Dynegy would be getting the full cooperation of Enron s management team, Watson said. Enron employees working for Dynegy will have to get used to a new culture. Teamwork and fraternal are words often used to describe Dynegy, while cutthroat is used for Enron, which also is known for its willingness to take more risk. Watson plans to blend strategies and business elements of each. The new company will include Enron s strong offering of financial products and combine them with Dynegy s base of power plants and other assets, said Steve Bergstrom, Dynegy s president, who will take the same job in the new company. The post-merger Dynegy will also be more involved in ""market-making,"" which Enron is known for. That s the practice of ensuring orderly markets can exist by acting as both the buyer and the seller of a commodity. It s unclear whether Dynegy will continue Enron s foray into other commodities such as paper and metals. Dynegy hopes Enron can complete its planned sale of assets considered outside its core wholesale energy business before the merger closes. Enron already has deals to sell power utility Portland General Electric along with about $900 million in international assets. Billions of dollars in international projects are for sale. But Watson said Dynegy isn t interested in seeing the assets go at bargain-basement prices. ""We don t necessarily feel like our back is pinned against the wall in asset dispositions,"" he said. Bottom of Form 1Business; Financial DeskDynegy, Enron Stock Prices Get Boost Energy: Even as experts warn of regulatory hurdles, investors back proposed merger.NANCY RIVERA BROOKSTIMES STAFF WRITER11/13/2001Los Angeles TimesHome EditionC-1Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror CompanyInvestors and analysts applauded the proposed $9-billion merger of Dynegy Inc. and Enron Corp., boosting the stock price of both Houston-based energy companies on Monday even as some experts warned of regulatory hurdles. Dynegy and Enron executives courted Wall Street by offering assurances that the combined company, to be called Dynegy, would be more financially conservative and easier to understand than Enron has been.Dynegy Chief Executive Charles L. Watson said the merger would immediately sweeten earnings for the combined company and that he remains ""90% certain"" that no more nasty surprises will emerge from a continuing internal investigation of Enron s cloudy finances. ""This is an exciting business combination ... that will fuse two groups of talented, dedicated people who share a passion for their work,"" said Watson, who would be chairman and chief executive of the new company. Dynegy s stock leaped $5.55 to close at $44.31 on the New York Stock Exchange while Enron s stock increased 61 cents to $9.24. The proposed transaction, revealed late Friday after days of rumors, marks an extraordinary humbling of Enron and its powerful chairman and CEO, Kenneth L. Lay. Enron is the world s largest energy trader, but a loss of investor confidence and a severe cash crunch have pushed it into the arms of a competitor that is one-quarter its size. Under the deal, Enron shareholders would get 0.2685 Dynegy share for each share of Enron stock. Based on the $38.76 close Friday of Dynegy s stock on the New York Stock Exchange, the deal valued Enron s stock at $10.40 a share--or $11.89 a share based on Monday s close. Dynegy would convert 850 million Enron shares, the company said. Dynegy said Monday that its deal is worth about $24 billion in all: the $9-billion stock swap and the assumption of $2 billion of preferred stock and $13 billion in debt. Enron would get an immediate cash infusion from ChevronTexaco Corp., which owns nearly 27% of Dynegy, with an additional $1billion to follow when the deal closes. Enron s stock fell 80% after a series of disturbing financial disclosures that began Oct. 16 with a surprise third-quarter loss tied to failed investments in water and telecommunications and losses from the termination of some off-balance-sheet partnerships. Enron also revealed that $1.2billion had been shaved off shareholders  equity because of those partnerships. The Securities and Exchange Commission launched an investigation into the investment vehicles, and the company fired three executives linked to the partnerships. An internal investigation led Enron to admit it overstated profit by $586 million, or 20%, going back to 1997. All those disclosures are unrelated to Enron s core businesses of energy trading, energy marketing and natural gas pipelines, said Dynegy President Steve Bergstrom, and it is those businesses that Dynegy wants. ""We have had the opportunity to look under the hood of their core businesses and have found no surprises,"" said Bergstrom, who would be president of the combined company. Dynegy expects those businesses alone to add as much as 95 cents a share to the combined company s earnings the first year, and Dynegy has built protections into the deal if more surprises emerge from noncore businesses or off-balance-sheet partnerships, the executives said. Among the protections: Dynegy or Enron would receive $350 million if the other backs out of the deal; Dynegy can abandon the transaction if lawsuit and financial liabilities exceed $3.5 billion; and if the deal falls apart, Dynegy gets Enron s Northern Natural Gas pipeline. The combined company would be leader in all of its primary businesses, Watson said, with revenue of more than $200 billion and assets of more than $90 billion. The new Dynegy would be the world s largest energy trader and would own 25,000 miles of natural gas pipelines and 22,500 megawatts of electricity generation. It is that powerhouse role that may give regulators pause, energy and antitrust experts say. California Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer has not taken a position on the proposed merger. Dynegy co-owns three power plants in California and Enron controls a portion of the state s natural gas supply through its pipeline and trading businesses.PHOTO: Kenneth Lay, left, and Chuck Watson announce proposed merger.; ; PHOTOGRAPHER: Associated Press Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The opinions expressed are his own.)       Las Vegas, Nov. 13 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. shareholders never blinked as Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay piled up pay -- salary, bonuses, stock grants and options -- that would meet almost any definition of excessive.      From 1993 to the end of 2000, Lay s potential compensation came to $614 million if you add unexercised option profits to the millions he actually pocketed.      Sad to say, Lay s paper profit of $362 million at the end of 2000 has evaporated as Enron s stock lost about 90 percent of its value. The Houston, Texas, energy company, beset by accounting problems, is now being bought by a smaller competitor, Dynegy Inc.      Still, the 59-year-old Lay hauled away $31.5 million a year in real dollars over the last eight years, a generous amount given Enron s recent admission -- after the Securities and Exchange Commission opened an investigation -- that it overstated earnings by $586 million in five of those years.      Lay was Enron s CEO from the time it was formed 15 years ago in a merger of natural-gas pipeline operators until he stepped down in February for prot?g? Jeffrey Skilling. Skilling left unexpectedly in August for ``personal   reasons.                            CEO S Return       In six months under Skilling, Enron s total return to shareholders was a negative 46 percent, four times worse than the performance of the Standard & Poor s 500 Index. It was also a sharp contrast to the 30 percent a year Enron returned to shareholders over the previous eight years under Lay, when the company s performance was almost double that of the S&P 500.      So Lay became CEO again after Skilling s mid-August departure -- and Enron s performance has now been even worse: minus 78 percent versus the 5.8 percent negative return of for the S&P 500.      While Lay has an employment agreement extending all the way to 2005, the company s pending acquisition by Dynegy leaves his future in doubt. For Enron s battered shareholders, whose stock once was among the S&P 500 s top performers, that may not be such bad news.      Enron shareholders endured a roller-coaster ride during Lay s long tenure, their stock 2.2 times as volatile as that of the S&P 500 Index.      Lay, and some other Enron executives, were responsible for at least some of the heavy activity in their company s shares. Lay exercised and sold option shares twice a day on every trading day this year through Aug. 21, on last report. In the process, he dumped about 300,000 option shares to reap about $26 million.                           Royal Treatment       That comes atop his realized option gains of $123 million in 2000 and another $44 million the year before that.      Shedding large numbers of option shares might seem reasonable for a CEO about to leave the company. For someone continuing as board chairman, such behavior raises suspicion he might have known before others what a bad investment Enron was about to become.      Over the past eight years, Lay has received bonuses totaling $19.8 million, free shares worth $12.7 million at the time of their grant, payouts under miscellaneous stock-option plans of $3.5 million and a whopping 11 million option shares.      Those figures don t include free personal travel on company planes. In 2000 alone, that little item came to $334,000.      If Lay has been handsomely compensated, he has treated his outside directors royally. Enron s current proxy statement informs shareholders that directors in 2000 received an average of $79,107 in cash, deferred compensation, phantom stock units and stock options granted in lieu of cash.                              Who Knew?       By itself, that figure might not seem egregious. Parsing the artful language of the proxy, one reads further to find that each outside director also received a stock option covering 10,775 shares at a strike price of $75.13 a share. I estimate the present value of that option to be $315,000, making for a director s total  pay of an eye-popping $394,000.      To be sure, those options are now way underwater, given Enron s closing price yesterday of $9.24. Still, the fact they were granted at all suggests that Enron s directors must have had a warm fuzzy feeling for Lay while treating him so munificently.      Politically, too, Lay has shown generosity and a deft touch: He gave $2,000 directly to President George W. Bush s campaign, another $275,000 in soft money to the Republican party and has long been an adviser to Bush on energy matters.      Even if he was unaware of the accounting issues that helped bring down Enron, Lay still profited hugely from a stock price that soared on the strength of inflated numbers. And, as the CEO, he bears ultimate responsibility for what goes on in the company he helped found and has run for most of the past 15 years.      The question arises, to echo a phrase made famous during the Watergate era: ``What did Ken Lay know, and when did he know it?    --Graef Crystal in Las Vegas (702) 270-6841 COMPANIES & FINANCE THE AMERICAS - Dynegy deal brings balance back to markets.By JULIE EARLE, SHEILA MCNULTY, PETER SPIEGEL and RICHARD WATERS.11/13/2001Financial Times(c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights ReservedDynegy s rescue takeover of Enron brought stability back to the companies  share prices and the energy markets as trading resumed yesterday morning. However, executives of the two companies faced a barrage of questions from investors and analysts over concerns that they had not yet got to the bottom of the complex transactions that nearly brought Enron down.Dynegy s shares jumped 15 per cent in early trade, while Enron s stock rose by more than 12 per cent, after the late-Friday deal that appeared to resolve Enron s immediate financial crisis. ""It s a sensational deal for Dynegy,"" said John Olson of Sanders Morris Harris, an investment banking firm in Houston. ""It is clearly the best deal of the year. When you can buy Enron at seven times earnings, at approximately book value, warts and all, you re getting a very good deal."" Dynegy said the merger would lift its earnings per share by 35 per cent next year. While the bounce in Enron s shares reflected relief that the company s immediate liquidity crisis was over, they were still trading at less than a third of their price of mid-October. Charles Watson, Dynegy chairman and chief executive, said the deal included provisions that would protect his company s shareholders if large unexpected liabilities emerged at Enron. He added that he was confident that an investigation into the off-balance sheet transactions at Enron had left little uncovered. Dynegy is able to walk away from the deal if Enron suffers more than $3.5bn in costs from shareholder lawsuits and other liabilities stemming from its disputed transactions, executives said. However, analysts questioned why, if Enron s core business was so strong, the company was being sold at such a discount. The deal could also face a tough review in Washington, given Dynegy s involvement as a big trader in many of the same markets where Enron is the dominant force. Antitrust experts said the deal might not get approval unless Enron can qualify as a ""failing firm"" under the Justice Department s 1992 merger guidelines. A failing-firm defence, used most recently by TWA when it was bought out by American Airlines in March, would require Enron to prove there was no other avenue - either through bankruptcy reorganisation or acquisition by a third company - which would allow it to remain a viable competitor. It would also have to show that, without the merger, it would completely exit the market altogether. Mr Watson also indicated that Dynegy would strip Enron s operations back to its core energy trading and pipeline businesses, raising the prospect of further significant sales and write-downs. ""The $6.5bn of (international) assets on Enron s books will get marked down dramatically,"" said Mr Olson. ""They also have to have a moment of truth with the assets in their telecommunications business."" Of about $1bn in broadband, he expects Enron to write off about $600m in hard assets. Other energy trading firms said that they were moving to reduce their exposure to the company, as the InterContinental Exchange (Ice), Enron s online rival, revealed record trading volumes last week, its best in 13 months of operation.

GLOBAL INVESTING - Spreading the risks - and the rewards.11/13/2001Financial Times(c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights ReservedJust as Enron is showing us how a public company should not shift private equity exposure off its balance sheet, Sandy Schwab, son of Charles Schwab, and Middlebury Capital, a New York-based hedge fund, are providing an alternative model. Mr Schwab s firm Chess Ventures is raising a private equity fund that will specialise in financial services technology, according to a source close to the fund-raising. The idea is to attract 10 to 12 banks from around the world to co-invest in technology companies specialising in financial services.The idea is similar to the corporate venturing activities undertaken by a host of California technology companies. They jumped into venture capital in the late 1990s, not just because there seemed to be stacks of money to be made, but also so they could become partners to thrusting future competitors, rather than victims of their cutting-edge technology. Technology is also a vital business for financial services companies - and not just for those like Schwab with a heavy presence in internet trading. Every year, banks and brokers plough hundreds of millions of dollars into trading, settlement and risk management systems. But the problems with corporate venturing became clear when companies such as JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Dell and Intel registered significant earnings volatility as the value of their venture capital holdings was marked down significantly. Enron got around these problems by setting up an off-balance sheet vehicle with a number of additional investors. Its idea was to distance its earnings statement from volatile investments in the New Power Company and Rhythm NetConnections. But eventually, those investments came home to roost. Enron had to compensate it co-investors in the structure for their losses arising from its private equity investments, and paid a heavy price for the apparent subterfuge of keeping them out of the public view. The Schwab fund seems to offer the benefits of corporate venturing without some of its costs. The investors, who it is hoped will eventually contribute $100m to $150m to the new fund, will share the benefits of whatever technology is developed and they will probably also be the first customers of the companies they are sponsoring. But because they are all taking a relatively small part of the pie they should ameliorate their overall risk. Spreading the risks like this would be hard to pull off in a totally domestic structure. Corporate venturing is, after all, meant to give a company an edge over its competitors. But diversifying the fund internationally should allow the Chess fund to spread the risks. The fundraisers are talking to banks in the UK and Scandinavia, among other places. If the theories of growing European cross-border integration and competition come to fruition some of the bank co-investors might end up competing but in the meantime separating investors by geography seems like a safe bet. Schwab and the other investors could, of course, have put their money into other stand-alone venture funds. That would at least have solved the problem of keeping their volatile private equity exposure on balance sheet, but stand-alone funds with the sharp focus that a corporate venturing outfit has are fairly few and far between. Corporate venture capital groups, where the corporation involved is a strategic investor rather than just a speculator, are usually narrowly focused on their parent group s industry because they are in the business of helping their parent develop a strategic edge. A few venture firms focus very narrowly on enterprise software but often they want to keep their options to invest in, say, biotechnology, if that area suddenly looks promising. For non-strategic investors that approach has clear advantages. Technology investments have suffered over the last 18 months, while biotech investments have held up relatively well. If investors are right about the dramatic impact of information technology on biotechnology, investors in a general fund that has had the foresight to bet on those changes will probably do very well. But the Schwab approach is all about venturing as a way to extend research and development. Venturing can tap into the reserves of entrepreneurship that have served the US so well in the 1990s in a way that traditional research and development probably cannot. Entrepreneurship does, however, come at a price. Young companies can and do fail. Their values can swing wildly. An off-balance sheet approach with clear strategic benefits might allow companies to have their cake and eat it. (c) Copyright Financial Times Ltd.

COMMENT & ANALYSIS - Enron reaps the whirlwind.By PETER MARTIN.11/13/2001Financial Times(c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights ReservedCOMMENT & ANALYSIS - Enron reaps the whirlwind - The energy group succeeded brilliantly for a time by creating markets to trade risk, but ended up absorbing too much. Enron s fate is a test case for one of the current era s most powerful beliefs. Actively traded markets, says the new orthodoxy, will replace cumbersome monolithic businesses.Electricity, computer chips, telecoms bandwidth, weather risks, petroleum products, reinsurance, housing finance, advertising space - the list of goods and services which the new market alchemy would transform is endless. Even 20 years ago, most of these commodities were exclusively handled through vertically integrated business empires. Some of them did not even exist as identifiable products, they were so tightly enmeshed with the business that produced and sold them. It all goes back to 1979. Together, the second oil shock and the election of Margaret Thatcher in Britain ushered in the market wave, forcing deregulation in the US oil and gas industries and a stream of utility privatisation. Enron, originally just a natural gas pipeline business, seized on the new opportunities - first in the US gas business, then in other areas of energy such as electricity, then in a much wider range of goods. It started trading these products and services as commodities. It was not an old-fashioned utility any more, but it was also more than a simple trader. Instead, as its former chief executive Jeffrey Skilling put it: ""Enron s operations are built around the integration of modern financial technologies and physical technologies."" It brought derivatives theory to boring old businesses like gas and electricity; and it brought a set of assets that could provide security of supply to the new dematerialised energy trading. We will come back to what went wrong at Enron later. But first notice how much went right in the newly market-oriented industries. Critics argued that an integrated business, tightly controlled from the centre, was essential for security of supply. But British electricity privatisation proved you could switch to a market-oriented system quickly and smoothly - and the lights stayed on. All you needed were proper regulations, a freely operating supply side and a bunch of active market-makers. These were not always present - for example, the absence of the first two gave California an electricity shortage. But if the markets were properly set up, everything worked like clockwork. The new era had a simple creed. Before there were effective markets, companies needed to be vertically integrated to cope with unexpected fluctuations in demand and supply. But now markets allowed them to handle that risk more efficiently, buying and selling what they needed. Trading exploded: Enron alone recorded revenues of over $100bn ( #68bn) in 2000. So what did go wrong? Enron expanded its markets too aggressively, moving far beyond energy through a web-based platform called EnronOnline. As Mr Skilling put it in an interview with BusinessWeek: ""We re on the side of angels. We re taking on the entrenched monopolies. We re bringing the benefits of choice and free markets to the world."" Expensively, Enron rushed into trading telecoms bandwidth, building a big network to ensure it could deliver a scale of demand that never materialised. Mr Skilling left abruptly in August, citing personal reasons. This autumn the company announced it had been engaging in transactions with supposedly independent entities that should, in fact, have been consolidated with its own accounts. Some of these were headed - in a clear conflict of interest - by its own chief financial officer. Correcting the accounting caused big restatements of earnings. This may, of course, just be the growing pains of an innovative but overly ambitious company. In that case, Enron may prosper under new ownership - it agreed to be taken over by Dynegy, a much smaller rival, on Friday. Dynegy will slash the range of Enron s activities to focus on energy. If the sale goes through, such an approach may restore Enron to health. But perhaps the Enron problems tell us something more significant about the rush to turn formerly integrated businesses into markets. To get these to work requires active market-makers like Enron. Creating liquidity in previously illiquid markets soaks up capital. Nalin Kulatilaka, professor of finance at Boston University s management school, has studied Enron for years. ""The bottom line is that when the liquidity on the two sides of a market are very different,"" he says, ""a company that tries to lead the way in creating these marketplaces is going to bear sustained liquidity risks."" The risks that the old system had coped with by building a layer of inefficiency into its operations did not go away in the new market era. Enron knew all about these risks: managing them, through complex trades, was its essential skill. James Lam, founder of the consultancy eRisk, says: ""Enron has always been recognised by other companies as best practice in risk management. It put in systems to manage risk on a real time basis, and had very strong management."" But risk is a bit like a balloon. Squeeze it down in one area and it bulges out in another. Even if the operational risk was managed with great skill, the underlying riskiness of the strategy Enron was pursuing could not be wished away. Except, perhaps, by transactions that passed it on to outside entities. The problem was that those entities were not really outside at all. Despite Enron s problems, the shift to a market-based approach is now irreversible - for energy markets at least. Ed Krapels, who runs Energy Security Analysis in Boston, says: ""Clearly Enron s trading culture has been adopted by every one of the big oil companies except Exxon."" But, he adds, there is a big difference between companies with trading at their core, like Enron and Dynegy, and those that have added a trading approach to a business fundamentally based on physical assets, such as BP. The leverage and aggression in such businesses is much lower. Dynegy s rescue of Enron was only made possible by an injection of cash from ChevronTexaco, which owns 26 per cent of Dynegy s shares. Call it the revenge of the entrenched monopolies. Energy markets may not be as efficient without an aggressive Enron. But if they come back into the embrace of the big physical operators, they may cope a little better with the unpredictable riskiness of the real world. peter.martin@ft.com.

Business; Financial DeskAndersen Could Face SEC Sanction, Suits Over Enron Accounting ErrorBloomberg News11/13/2001Los Angeles TimesHome EditionC-7Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror CompanyHOUSTON -- Arthur Andersen may face U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sanction and shareholder lawsuits because it certified Enron Corp. financial reports that the company disavowed last week as inaccurate, legal and accounting experts said. Andersen, the world s fifth-largest accounting firm, served as Enron s outside auditor for more than a decade. Last week, the company reported that it overstated earnings by $586 million over 41/2 years, inflated shareholder equity by $1.2 billion because of an ""accounting error,"" and failed to consolidate results of three affiliated partnerships into its balance sheet.Enron restated its financial reports as the company suffered a cash crisis triggered by disclosure of the cut in shareholder equity and the start of an SEC investigation. ""I d be very surprised if the SEC didn t go after Arthur Andersen,"" said Alan Bromberg, securities law professor at Southern Methodist University. Andersen partner David Tabolt has said the firm is cooperating with a special committee of Enron s board of directors appointed to investigate the accounting problems. Lynn Turner, who was the SEC s chief accountant for three years until he resigned in August, said Enron and Andersen ignored a basic accounting rule when they overstated shareholder equity. Explaining the equity reduction last week, Enron said it had given common stock to companies created by Enron s former chief financial officer in exchange for notes receivable, and then improperly increased shareholder equity on its balance sheet by the value of the notes. ""What we teach in college is that you don t record equity until you get cash for it, and a note is not cash,"" said Turner, who is now director of the Center for Quality Financial Reporting at Colorado State University. ""It s a mystery how both the company would violate, and the auditors would miss, such a basic accounting rule, when the number is $1 billion.""Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

All Rights Reserved.HOUSTON (AP) - While troubled Enron Corp. brings a certain amount of financial baggage in its union with rival Dynegy Inc., the merger will create a new company that while strong won t dominate the energy market, according to several analysts. But others still expressed concerns with the deal between the two Houston-based companies, citing strategic and cultural differences between the two companies and potential antitrust issues.Meanwhile, investors on Monday gave a tentative thumbs up to the merger. Dynegy shares rose $5.55, or 14 percent, to close at $44.31, while Enron shares were up 61 cents, or 7 percent to $9.24 on the New York Stock Exchange. Enron s financial crises had left many fearing severe disruptions in the energy market, Daniel Ford, an analyst with Lehman Brothers wrote Monday in a research note to clients. ""We believe the terms of the announced merger agreement are a path to resolving these fears,"" Ford wrote. Duane Grubert, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein and Co., said any antitrust concerns that might arise from the deal will be minimal because the energy market will be able to absorb the new company s impact. ""While there is risk, the prize is so big the parties will go through it and the deal will ultimately close,"" Grubert said. But Carol Coale, an analyst with Prudential Securities Inc., wrote in a research note to clients she had several concerns about the deal, including whether Dynegy will be successful in retaining Enron s ""talented"" energy trading and marketing personnel and whether both companies have compatible trading strategies. Dynegy officials said Monday the proposed deal was ""doable,"" would clear all antitrust hurdles and be completed within nine months. ""What we have done is literally taken the worst case (scenario) and even in the worst case there is a lot of economic value for both companies,"" said Chuck Watson, chairman and chief executive officer of Dynegy, during a conference call Monday. The deal, worth at least $9 billion, was announced Friday. Dynegy will also assume $13 billion of Enron debt. The Enron name will disappear. Under the deal, ChevronTexaco Corp., which owns more than a quarter of Dynegy, would immediately provide about $1.5 billion. ChevronTexaco would contribute an additional $1 billion upon completion of the deal. Dynegy s earnings for 2002, before the merger, were expected to range between $2.50 and $2.60. The buyout now raises that to between $3.40 and $3.50, said company spokeswoman Jennifer Rosser. According to Thomson Financial/First Call, analysts were expecting Dynegy to earn $2.57 a share next year. Dynegy officials pledged Monday that they won t tolerate the sort of financial practices that prompted Enron to acknowledge last week that it overstated earnings by about 20 percent since 1997. Those financial practices included business partnerships now under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Enron, the nation s top buyer and seller of natural gas reported a $618 million third quarter loss on Oct. 16 and disclosed a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity related to the partnerships. Worries about Enron s financial stability eventually caused shares to plunge 80 percent, leaving Enron open for a takeover bid. Officials with both companies said if for some reason the deal falls through, Dynegy will be given Enron s Northern Natural Gas pipeline in compensation for the $1.5 billion cash infusion Enron received. The agreement also has a clause that would allow Dynegy to opt out of the deal if Enron s litigation and other costs surpass $3.5 billion, Dynegy officials said Monday. --- On the Net: http://www.enron.com http://www.dynegy.comCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

All Rights ReservedUS equities fell sharply in morning trading after an American Airlines jet crashed near New York s JFK airport, sparking a nervous selloff on Wall Street. Two months after the September 11 terrorist attacks in the US, the markets were again deeply nervous. A positive opening quickly evaporated following news of the crash, which renewed concerns about safety in the airline industry.By midsession, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 166.20 to 9,441.80 while the S&P 500 index fell 15.93 to 1,104.38. The Nasdaq Composite lost 23.23 to 1,805.25. After an initial selling spree, stocks trimmed some of their losses as investors anxiously awaited details to determine the cause of the crash. ""This just knocked the wind out of the market,"" said Christopher Wolfe, US equity strategist at JP MorganChase. ""If it s deemed to be an accident, the stock market will respond better."" The airline industry took a sharp hit as the Amex airline index tumbled 7 per cent at $64.25. Shares in AMR Corp, the parent of American Airlines, gave up 13.3 per cent at $15.72 while Northwest fell 6 per cent at $12.75. Hotel and other travel-related companies were also lower as Carnival Corporation fell 4.4 per cent at $23.09 and Starwood Hotel and Resorts shed 4.5 per cent at $23.12. Aircraft maker Boeing fell 2.4 per cent at $32.43 and United Technologies lost 4 per cent at $54.69. Shares in Honeywell and General Electric were off 5.5 per cent and 4.2 per cent, respectively. All other Dow components were also trading lower. Dynergy jumped 13 per cent at $43.84 after the energy trading company agreed to acquire its larger rival Enron in an $8bn rescue deal. Enron rose 11 per cent at $9.59. Other energy stocks traded lower. Exxon Mobil fell 1.6 per cent at $39.60. Ciena Corp gained 10 per cent at $18.94 after the fibere-optic networking equipment maker said it would meet or top fourth-quarter sales forecasts. The company also said it would cut 380 jobs, or 10 per cent of its workforce. Cisco Systems fell 2 per cent at $18.84 while Juniper Networks added 2.6 per cent at $24.06. Shares in Intel retreated 1.4 per cent at $27.50 and Microsoft dipped 0.6 per cent at $64.80. Insurance companies were mostly lower with Conseco down 3 per cent at $3.86 and Metlife off 0.7 per cent at $27.34. Toronto picked up from early lows, but remained under pressure. By midsession, the S&P 300 composite index was still nursing a loss of 0.6 per cent at 7,163.90. Trade, however was thin with many investors absent for the Remembrance Day holiday.

BusinessDynegy seen as winner in Enron deal ; Firm gets rights to key pipelineMelita Marie Garza, Tribune staff reporter11/13/2001Chicago TribuneNorth Sports Final ; N1(Copyright 2001 by the Chicago Tribune)Shares of Dynegy Inc. shot up 14 percent on Monday as investors calculated that the Houston-based power-trading company will win big whether or not regulators approve its blockbuster merger with hometown rival Enron Corp. Under terms of the deal, Dynegy executives said in a conference call with analysts on Monday, their company will get rights to Enron s prized Northern Natural Gas pipeline in return for $1.5 billion invested in Enron. Moreover, the deal calls for Enron to pay Dynegy $350 million if Enron walks away to accept a higher bid from another company.Particularly lucrative for Dynegy, analysts said, are the rights it obtained to acquire the Northern Natural Gas pipeline. The pipeline is an interstate transmission system, providing transportation among other supply conduits and serving customers in the upper Midwest through a 17,000-mile network. For this and other reasons, Dynegy stock closed at $44.31, up $5.55, on the first trading day after the $24 billion merger deal was announced. Enron, the nation s largest trader of natural gas and electricity, has been bowed in recent weeks by soured transactions with energy partnerships run by one of its former executives and by a revelation about questionable accounting practices. Enron last week was forced to revise down its earnings for the past five years and has seen its debt ratings downgraded and its stock price plummet. But Chuck Watson, Dynegy s chief executive, said during the conference call that he did not anticipate any more nasty surprises arising from Enron s convoluted books. ""We literally have taken what we think is the worst case scenario,"" Watson said. ""I m comfortable that even in that case this is a very, very good economic transaction for both companies."" Dynegy executives estimated an annual earnings-per-share growth of 15 percent to 20 percent for the combined company over the next three years. Under the stock-for-stock-swap portion of the deal, valued at $8.85 billion, Dynegy is paying the equivalent of $10.41 a share for the 850 million outstanding Enron shares. Dynegy would pay .2685 shares of its stock for each share of Enron. In addition, Dynegy agreed to assume an estimated $13 billion in debt. It is conceivable that additional problems with Enron s off- balance sheet partnerships could kill the proposed deal between the two power-trading rivals. But on Monday, Kenneth Lay, Enron s chief executive, said: ""We don t have anything we are trying to hide. On the contrary, we have been very forthcoming of everything we have found. We have disclosed anything and everything that we have found so far."" Despite its sanguine outlook on the deal, Dynegy officials acknowledged that they have escape clauses in their offer. For example, Dynegy can renege on the deal if pending litigation against Enron, which includes a slew of lawsuits filed by disgruntled investors who have lost millions of dollars, exceeds $3.5 billion in costs. Since last Wednesday, when Dynegy shares closed at $33, the stock has risen more than 33 percent. After rumors began swirling last Thursday that it was in talks with Enron, its shares rose to $36.50. On Friday, after making the bid for Enron, its shares closed at $38.76, for a rise of 17.5 percent in two days of trading. By comparison, Enron stock rose 7.1 percent, to $9.24, on Monday and has risen only 2 percent since last Wednesday. Dynegy officials on Monday also sought to quell rumors that the deal was greased because Enron owed Dynegy money. In fact, ""Dynegy currently owes Enron...less than $50 million,"" said Rob Doty, chief financial officer of Dynegy.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 	UK: Innogy restarts energy trading with Enron.11/13/2001Reuters English News Service(C) Reuters Limited 2001.LONDON, Nov 13 (Reuters) - British power company Innogy on Tuesday said it had resumed trading with crisis-hit U.S. energy group Enron after a 14-day cessation. In the first confirmation that it had stopped trading with the U.S. group, Innogy said in a statement ""the situation now seems to have been resolved and business will resume"".Innogy said there had been little impact on it as a result of the suspension of trading. But industry experts said the implications for Enron could be larger because a number of large European energy groups suspended dealings with it at the end of last month. Enron ran into a crisis of investor confidence in mid-October when it disclosed previously unbooked charges, and is now the object of a $9 billion rescue takeover offer from smaller rival Dynegy .Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Report on Business: InternationalEnron, Dynegy shares climb Industry observers give takeover bid mixed reviewsJANET McGURTYReuter News Agency11/13/2001The Globe and MailMetroB15""All material Copyright (c) Bell Globemedia Publishing Inc. and its licensors. All rights reserved.""NEW YORK -- Shares of Enron Corp. climbed higher yesterday on investor enthusiasm over last week s $9-billion (U.S.) bid by rival energy trader Dynegy Inc. to take over the beleaguered energy giant. Dynegy gained $5.55, or 14.3 per cent, to $44.31 on the New York Stock Exchange, while shares of Enron rose 69 cents, or 8 per cent, to $9.32. The takeover announced Friday halted a free-fall in Enron s stock that lost about 75 per cent of its market capitalization in the past month.However, Enron s stock was trading well below the value of Dynegy s offer of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for each Enron share, which translates into $11.94 a share. Analysts said this likely reflected doubts in some investors minds as to whether the deal, which includes ""escape clauses"" for Dynegy, will go through. Some industry analysts said they were impressed by the upfront details offered by Dynegy during a conference call with analysts, an about-face compared with calls with Enron. A lack of transparency from Enron about its off-balance-sheet transactions, along with a U.S. regulatory investigation, had sparked widespread investor unease. ""I would say that after listening to the conference call, I am even more comfortable with my initial judgment that the projections are conservative,"" said Jay Yannello, an analyst with UBS Warburg. Earlier, Mr. Yannello reiterated a ""strong buy"" on Dynegy, saying while the brokerage does not underestimate the enormous challenge at hand, the takeover should yield the biggest and most credible energy merchant in the world. Dynegy is about one-fifth the size of Enron when measured by revenues. Enron s woes came to light in mid-October after the biggest energy trader in North America disclosed that some of its off-balance-sheet partners contributed to a $1-billion charge and a $1.2-billion reduction in shareholder equity. The takeover is an attractive transaction because of Enron s trading operations, which combined with Dynegy s above-board culture based on teamwork, strict values and honesty, should yield a formidable company, Mr. Yannello said. However, last week some antitrust lawyers said the deal will be closely examined by the Federal Trade Commission because of the combined company s market share in energy trading, said Steve Newborn, formerly in charge of FTC merger enforcement. Gordon Howald, an analyst at Credit Lyonnais Securities, said he is favourably disposed toward the takeover, which he called a ""low risk-high reward proposition."" The most critical component is the immediate $1.5-billion equity infusion by Dynegy shareholder ChevronTexaco Corp. into Enron that will bolster Enron and help keep it viable. Some analysts are less sanguine. They said Dynegy is making a big bet that it can successfully clean up Enron s balance sheet problems as well as integrate its trading and marketing business without losing a lot of key traders and volumes.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

City - City Comment - Enron s end provides textbook disaster study.11/13/2001The Daily TelegraphP40(c) Telegraph Group Limited, London, 2001A YEAR ago Enron, North America s biggest natural gas and power business with a growing European presence, chalked up $101 billion in revenues and saw its market value reach the giddy heights of almost $80 billion. Yesterday it was coming to terms with being part of Dynegy, its junior rival in Houston, taken out at a price which just allows it to escape the ignominy of the 90pc club. In less than three weeks the one-time Wall Street darling has been humbled by a sequence of events that stunned the market and will provide business schools with a classic casebook disaster study.The Enron demise is one which cannot be blamed on the events of September 11. A third-quarter loss, followed by an equity write-down, the disclosure of questionable off-balance-sheet businesses, an admission that earnings have been over-stated and a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation brought Enron to the brink of collapse. Ken Lay, its chairman, had taken full advantage of market deregulation to build Enron into a multi-national utility with a network of power plants, gas pipelines and a powerful trading presence, in everything from energy to metals. It trades these from an office in Victoria which employs 2,000 people, and Mr Lay might have wondered rather earlier how this army of people could possibly pay for themselves, even in his brave new deregulated world. Now Dynegy has picked up Enron cheaply, and must find its way off debt mountain before the financial weather gets worse. The new group has sales of more than $200 billion, and ass"

Now shareholders could be on the hook for =a $65 billion tab.Janice Revell11/26/2001Fortune MagazineTime Inc.131(Copyright 2001)It was an irresistible proposition: Borrow billions of dollars, pay no inte=rest, reap millions in tax breaks, and then wait for the debt to simply dis=appear. That was the promise of zero-coupon convertible bonds, and companie=s from Enron to Merrill Lynch binged on what seemed like free money.=20But, of course, there was a catch: For this scenario to play out, a company= s stock price had to rise sharply--and quickly. That s because investors b=ought the bonds in the hope of converting them into equity--if the stock ta=nked, the bonds would no longer be worth converting. So to make them more a=ttractive to buyers, companies had to build in an escape hatch: If the stoc=k price failed to rise sufficiently, investors could ""put"" (that is, sell) =the bonds back to the company--in many cases, after just one year.And that s exactly what s about to happen--to the tune of some $65 billion =over the next three years. Stock prices have fallen so far that for at leas=t half of these special hybrids, the prospect of conversion is now absurd. =It simply won t happen. So bondholders are looking to get their money back =the first chance they can. And because of the put feature, that is possible=. Suddenly companies like Tyco, Comcast, and dozens more are on the hook fo=r billions of dollars in debt and interest they thought they d never have t=o pay.=20That could be very bad news for shareholders of these companies. After all,= they re the ones who are going to be picking up the tab when all that debt= comes due. Huge chunks of cash will disappear from balance sheets to repay= bondholders. Companies without enough cash-- and the majority fall into th=is camp--are likely to face skyrocketing interest charges when they borrow =money anew. That means sharply reduced earnings. Especially at risk are inv=estors in companies with poor credit ratings--prime candidates for killer r=efinancing costs. Some companies may even be forced to issue stock to pay o=ff the debt, creating significant shareholder dilution, especially at curre=nt depressed prices. To make matters worse, this is happening at a time whe=n the economy is barreling downhill and corporate profits are already shrin=king. ""This is a ticking time bomb,"" warns Margaret Patel, manager of the P=ioneer High Yield Bond fund, a top-performing junk fund.=20The seeds of this mess were sown in mid-2000, when the stock market started= to falter. Companies in search of capital balked at the thought of selling= stock while their share prices were struggling. Zero-coupon convertible bo=nds presented an attractive alternative because companies didn t have to ma=ke cash interest payments on the bonds (hence the name ""zero""). Instead iss=uers offered an up-front discount--for instance, investors would buy a bond= for $700 and collect $1,000 when it matured.=20Companies also gave investors the right to convert the bonds into a fixed n=umber of common shares. But the bonds were structured so that conversion wo=uld make sense only if the stock price rose significantly--in many cases, b=y more than 50%. With that protective feature (called the conversion premiu=m), zeros took off. Corporate issuers would pay no interest, and once their= stock prices had climbed back to acceptable levels, the debt would be swep=t away into equity. ""If the bonds are converted, it s a home run for everyb=ody,"" says Jonathan Cohen, vice president of convertible-bond analysis at D=eutsche Bank.=20That four-bagger, of course, depends entirely on the stock price rising. If= it doesn t, the bondholders, armed with that handy put feature, can simply= sell the bonds back to the company. Great for bondholders, but not so hot =for the company or its shareholders. But, hey, what are the odds of that ha=ppening? ""CFOs and CEOs believe that their stock will just continue to go u=p,"" says Cohen. ""They don t worry about the bond getting put.""=20If all this seems a little complicated, that s because it is. A real-life e=xample should help. California-based electric utility Calpine issued $1 bil=lion in zeros in April to refinance existing debt. At the time, the company= s stock was trading at about $55 a share--severely undervalued in the opin=ion of company management. ""We really didn t want to sell equity at that po=int,"" says Bob Kelly, Calpine s senior vice president of finance. So the co=mpany instead opted to sell zeros, setting the conversion premium at a heft=y 37%.=20Still, with no cash interest payments and a stock price that had to rise si=gnificantly to make conversion worthwhile, the bonds weren t exactly a scre=aming buy for investors. So Calpine added the put feature: Investors could =sell the bonds back to the company after one year at the full purchase pric=e, eliminating any downside risk.=20Things haven t exactly worked out as management had hoped. The stock has si=nce plummeted to $25, and it now has to triple before conversion makes sens=e. So it s looking as though Calpine will be liable for the $1 billion in b=orrowed money when investors get the chance to put the bonds this April. Th=ere s also the refinancing cost. According to Kelly, Calpine s borrowing ra=te could run in the neighborhood of 8.5%--an extra $85 million per year in =cash. ""Obviously, nobody plans for their stock to go down,"" Kelly says. ""I =don t think there was one person around who thought the bond would be put.""==20Calpine s potential costs are particularly high because its credit rating i=s straddling junk. ""If you are a borderline investment-grade company, a fin=ancing of this nature is not necessarily the most appropriate thing in the =world,"" notes Anand Iyer, head of global convertible research at Morgan Sta=nley. The problem is, there are a slew of companies with far worse credit r=atings out there: Jeff Seidel, Credit Suisse First Boston s head of convert=ible-bond research, estimates that about half of all zeros outstanding fall= into the junk category. And others are at risk of having their ratings dow=ngraded before the put date. Today, with junk yielding as much as 5 1/2 per=centage points above bonds rated investment grade, refinancing can be a pri=cey proposition.=20Contract manufacturer Solectron is one that could well get hit by the high =price of junk. It has $845 million in zeros that it will probably have to b=uy back this January, and another $4.2 billion coming down the pike over th=e next couple of years. Because of slower- than-expected sales, the company= was recently put on negative credit watch by three rating agencies. And if= Solectron s credit is downgraded, the zeros would slide into junk status, =a situation that could cost the company--and its shareholders--tens of mill=ions of dollars in refinancing charges.=20Refinancing isn t the only worrisome cost associated with these zeros. Comp=anies pay hefty investment banking fees to sell their bonds--up to 3% of th=e amount raised. If the debt is sold back, many will have spent millions fo=r what essentially amounted to a one-year loan. ""They re getting bad advice=,"" claims one banker who didn t want to be named. ""Look at the fee the bank=er earned and look at the kind of financing risk the company got into.""=20As if those potential consequences were not scary enough, shareholders can =also get whacked when the bonds are first issued. That s because some 40% a=re bought by hedge funds, which short the company s stock (sell borrowed sh=ares with the intention of buying them back at a lower price) at the same t=ime that they buy the bonds. If the stock goes down, the shorts make money =from their position. If it goes up, they profit by converting the bond to s=tock. This hedging strategy almost always causes the stock to plummet, at l=east for a while. Grocery chain Supervalu, for example, recently lost 10% o=f its market cap the day it announced it was issuing $185 million in zeros.==20Despite all the pitfalls, the love affair with such Pollyanna bonds continu=es, thanks in large part to the slick tax and accounting loopholes they pro=vide. In fact, the hit on earnings per share can be the lowest of any form =of financing. Even better, thanks to a wrinkle in the tax code, companies c=an rake in huge tax savings by deducting far more interest than they re act=ually paying. All they have to do is agree to pay small amounts of interest= if certain conditions prevail. Verizon Communications, for instance, would= pay 0.25% annual interest on its $3 billion in zero bonds if its stock pri=ce falls below 60% of the issue s conversion price. In the eyes of the IRS,= oddly, that clause enables the company to take a yearly interest deduction=, for tax purposes, of 7.5%--the same rate it pays on its regular debt. (Wh=y? Trust us, you don t want to know.) That adds up to an annual deduction o=f more than $200 million, even if Verizon never shells out a dime in intere=st. Not surprisingly, more than half of the zeros issued in 2001 contain si=milar clauses. ""It s an incredible deal for them,"" says Vadim Iosilevich, w=ho runs a hedge fund at Alexandra Investment Management. ""Not only are they= raising cheap money, they re also doing tax arbitrage.""=20So despite the enormous risks to shareholders, companies continue to issue =zeros at a steady clip: According to ConvertBond.com, seven new issues, tot=aling $3.5 billion, have been sold since Oct. 1 alone. ""I think the power o=f the tax advantage is going to keep them around,"" says CSFB s Seidel. Call= it greed or just blind optimism that the markets will recover quickly--it =doesn t really matter.

All Rights Reserved. =09Manager s Journal: What Enron Did RightBy Samuel Bodily and Robert Bruner11/19/2001The Wall Street JournalA20(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)This is a rough era for American business icons. Subject to the vagaries of= age (Jack Welch), product failure (Ford/Firestone tires), competition (Luc=ent, AT&T), technology (Hewlett-Packard and Compaq), and dot-bomb bubbles (=CMGI), managers and their firms remind us that being an icon is risky busin=ess. The latest example is Enron, whose fall from grace has resulted in a p=roposed fire sale to Dynegy.=20Once considered one of the country s most innovative companies, Enron becam=e a pariah due to lack of transparency about its deals and the odor of conf=licts of interest. The journalistic accounts of Enron s struggles drip with= schadenfreude, hinting that its innovations and achievements were all a mi=rage.We hold no brief regarding the legal or ethical issues under investigation.= We agree that more transparency about potential conflicts of interest is n=eeded. High profitability does not justify breaking the law or ethical norm=s. But no matter how the current issues resolve themselves or what fresh re=velations emerge, Enron has created an enormous legacy of good ideas that h=ave enduring value.=20-- Deregulation and market competition. Enron envisioned gas and electric p=ower industries in the U.S. where prices are set in an open market of biddi=ng by customers, and where suppliers can freely choose to enter or exit. En=ron was the leader in pioneering this business.=20Market competition in energy is now the dominant model in the U.S., and is =spreading to Europe, Latin America, and Asia. The winners have been consume=rs, who have paid lower prices, and investors, who have seen competition fo=rce the power suppliers to become much more efficient. The contrary experie=nce of California, the poster child of those who would re-regulate the powe=r industry, is an example of not enough deregulation.=20-- Innovation and the ""de-integration"" of power contracts. Under the old re=gulated model of delivering gas and electricity, customers were offered a o=ne-size-fits-all contract. For many customers, this system was inflexible a=nd inefficient, like telling a small gardener that you can only buy manure =by the truckload. Enron pioneered contracts that could be tailored to the e=xact needs of the customer.=20To do this, Enron unbundled the classic power contract into its constituent= parts, starting with price and volume, location, time, etc., and offered c=ustomers choices on each one. Again, consumers won. Enron s investors did t=oo, because Enron earned the surplus typically reaped by inventors. Arguabl=y, Enron is the embodiment of what economist Joseph Schumpeter called the ""=process of Creative Destruction."" But creative destroyers are not necessari=ly likable, pleasant folks, which may be part of Enron s problem today.=20-- Minimization of transaction costs and frictions. Enron extended the logi=c of de-integration to other industries. An integrated paper company, for i=nstance, owns forests, mills, pulp factories, and paper plants in what amou=nts to a very big bet that the paper company can run all those disparate ac=tivities better than smaller, specialized firms. Enron argued that integrat=ed firms and industries are riddled with inefficiencies stemming from burea=ucracy and the captive nature of ""customers"" and ""suppliers."" Enron envisio=ned creating free markets for components within the integrated chain on the= bet that the free-market terms would be better than those of the internal =operations. The development of free-market benchmarks for the terms by whic=h divisions of integrated firms do business with each other is very healthy= for the economy.=20-- Exploiting the optionality in networks. In the old regulated environment=, natural gas would be supplied to a customer through a single dedicated pi=peline. Enron envisioned a network by which gas could be supplied from a nu=mber of possible sources, opening the customer to the benefits of competiti=on, and the supplier to the flexibility of alternative sourcing strategies.= Enron benefited from controlling switches on the network, so that they cou=ld nimbly route the molecules or electrons from the best source at any mome=nt in time to the best use, and choose when and where to convert molecules =to electrons. This policy, picked up by others in the industry, created tre=mendous value for both customers and suppliers.=20-- Rigorous risk assessment. The strategy of tailored contracts could easil=y have broken the firm in the absence of a clear understanding of the tradi=ng risks that the firm assumed, and of very strong internal controls. Enron= pioneered risk assessment and control systems that we judge to be among th=e best anywhere. Particularly with the advent of Enron Online, where Enron =made new positions valued at over $4 billion each day, it became essential =to have up-to-the-second information on company-wide positions, prices and =ability to deliver.=20The unexpected bad news from Enron has little to do with trading losses by =the firm, but with fears among trading partners about Enron s ability to fi=nance its trading activity. In a world where contracts and trading portfoli=os are too complex to explain in a sound bite, counterparties look to a thi=ck equity base for assurance. It was the erosion in equity, rather than tra=ding risk, that destroyed the firm.=20-- A culture of urgency, innovation and high expectations. Enron s corporat=e culture was the biggest surprise of all. The Hollywood stereotype of a ut=ility company is bureaucratic, hierarchical, formal, slow, and full of excu=ses. And the stodgy images of a gas pipeline company -- Enron only 15 years= ago -- is even duller and slower. Enron became bumptious, impatient, lean,= fast, innovative, and demanding. It bred speed and innovation by giving it=s professionals unusual freedom to start new businesses, create markets, an=d transfer within the firm.=20Success was rewarded with ample compensation and fast promotion, and an ope=n-office design fostered brainstorming. The firm s organization and culture= was by all accounts not a safe haven for those who believe the role of a l=arge corporation is to fulfill entitlements for jobs. This was a lightning =rod for the firm s detractors. And yet, it could serve as a model for more =hide-bound enterprises to emulate.=20Enron was a prolific source of compelling new ideas about the transformatio=n of American business. It created a ruckus in once-quiet corners of the bu=siness economy. It rewrote the rules of competition in almost every area in= which it did business. It thrived on volatility.=20The proposed sale of Enron to Dynegy risks the loss of a major R&D establis=hment, especially given Dynegy s track record as a second mover following E=nron s lead. Beyond what is likely to be a difficult and time-consuming ant=itrust review, Dynegy s greater challenge will be to find a way to make Enr=on s spirit of innovation its own. Or so we all should hope, because prospe=rity depends on the ability of firms to reinvent themselves and remake thei=r industries.=20---=20Messrs.

The value of its stock basket fell 8.6% during th=e third quarter.Just six of the 15 financial firms managed to beat the benchmark Standard &= Poor s 500-stock index, which dropped 14.7% during the period. Among the s=tar performers that came to J.P.

Instead, =the firm s portfolio is weighted toward health care and consumer staples, a=s well as cyclical stocks such as energy and farm equipment.=20The quarter was among the roughest in years for Wall Street investors. The =terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 helped contribute to the stock-market losses,= which drove down the value of all portfolios in the survey, though the mar=kets have since recovered to their pre-Sept. 11 levels.

That crisis led to Enron s decision e=arlier this month to be acquired by Dynegy Inc., a much smaller rival.The German Bank, Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale of Dusseldorf, or Wes=tLB, is among several suitors for Wessex Water, people close to the discuss=ions said. The sale has also attracted the attention of industry rivals lik=e Thames Water, owned by RWE of Germany. But such a combination would most =likely incur a long review by regulators, who might either block the merger= on antitrust grounds, or exact stiff concessions, industry experts said.==20Wessex Water is likely to be sold for more than $:1 billion ($1.4 billion) =but less than the $:1.4 billion that Enron paid for it in 1998, analysts sa=id.=20  In hindsight, we made some very bad investments in noncore businesses,   =Kenneth L. Lay, Enron s chairman and chief executive, told analysts in a co=nference call last week. Those investments   have performed far worse than =we ever could have imagined,   he said, citing the Azurix water business, o=f which Wessex Water is a part, and energy assets in Brazil and India.=20Executives from Enron were not immediately available for comment today. Wes=tLB executives declined to comment.=20WestLB has been aggressively pursuing acquisitions in Britain, bidding for =British Telecommunications  phone network and the nation s railway tracks c=ontrolled by the troubled Railtrack, which is restructuring under governmen=t supervision. Neither of those bids has progressed beyond the initial stag=es.=20Last summer, WestLB helped finance the management buyout of the Mid Kent Wa=ter Company through Swan Capital, its private equity vehicle.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Here was new money, meaning new spending on p=lants, equipment and jobs that could help pull the economy out of its slump=.=20That $10.9 billion AT&T deal, and a slew of similar bond deals from big com=panies ranging from Boeing and Anheuser-Busch to Kraft Foods and General Mo=tors, may not provide as big of a boost as economists are banking on. That =is because corporations, like homeowners, are in the midst of a refinancing= boom.Corporations are hitting the market not just because rates are cheap, but b=ecause they often can t get money in other crucial markets. In particular, =they are sidestepping the commercial paper market -- short-term corporate I=OUs used to finance day-to-day operations, where rates traditionally are lo=west -- because investors are unwilling to finance many well-known corporat=ions.=20The result has been a huge jump in bond sales, the majority of which are us=ed to reduce existing debt. Since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, about $13=5 billion in investment-grade bonds have been sold, up from about $78 billi=on in the year-earlier period. Overall issuance this year is likely to set =a record, clearing $600 billion, compared with $411 billion in 2000.=20""The driving force behind this surge in bond issuance is refinancing short-=term commercial paper to long-term debt,"" says John Lonski, chief economist= at Moody s Investors Service, a credit-rating agency.=20Usually, rising bond issuance presages economic growth. In 1991, corporatio=ns sold a record number of bonds to exploit falling interest rates. But the=n, companies poured much of the money they raised back into their operation=s, a flurry of investment that foreshadowed the economic boom of the late 1=990s.=20This time around, the surge in bond deals won t pump in enough new money to= the economy to make a dramatic difference. Though, as in the case of the m=illions of homeowners who are refinancing their mortgages to lower monthly =payments, it could help ease some pressure on stretched corporate-balance s=heets and help to fund some of the companies  day-to-day operations.=20Not all of the money being raised is to refinance short-term debt, of cours=e, and the string of bond deals shows that many of the nation s biggest bor=rowers have ready access to funding if they need it.=20But most companies are similar to AT&T, which last week provided the bigges=t refinancing example yet.=20Over the next three months, the telecom company was facing $6.5 billion in =expiring commercial paper. Under normal conditions, corporations pay off ma=turing commercial paper by ""rolling over"" that debt, or issuing new commerc=ial paper to replace the old. But rolling over commercial paper became much= harder for AT&T after Moody s cut the company s short-term and long-term c=redit ratings. Through the bond deal, AT&T raised money at relatively attra=ctive rates while avoiding the difficulties of the commercial-paper market.==20Other companies facing downgrades also are scrambling to find alternatives =to the commercial-paper market through bonds, loans or revolving credit lin=es. ""The ripple effects of this are being felt throughout the capital marke=ts,"" says Meredith Coffey, senior vice president at Loan Pricing Corp., a d=ebt-market-analysis company.=20For the most extreme cases, the bond markets don t offer refuge. Enron, ham=mered by a third-quarter loss of $618 million that led to a string of downg=rades, drew down $3.3 billion from its emergency bank credit line to repay =investors in its commercial paper. It then turned to its banks for an addit=ional $1 billion loan to pay off more commercial-paper investors, thus tidi=ng it over until it could merge with rival Dynegy.=20Most investment-grade companies aren t nearly so bad off, and thus have rea=dy access to bond investors. General Motors, for instance, had little troub=le selling $6 billion in debt last month, while Ford Motor easily sold bond=s totalling $9.4 billion.=20But the surge in bond sales masks signs that even investment-grade companie=s are having trouble convincing investors that they are good for their mone=y.=20Take Ford. Standard & Poor s and Moody s downgraded Ford s debt ratings las=t month to triple-B-plus and single-A-3, respectively. With that rating, Fo=rd is far enough down the spectrum of investment-grade debt that many of th=e ultraconservative investors in commercial paper won t touch it, meaning t=hat it had to turn to corporate bonds to refinance its debt. Ford concedes =that a big reason it is selling bonds was to avoid the trouble in the comme=rcial-paper market.=20Boyce Greer, the money-market group leader at Fidelity Investments, says he= often stops buying the commercial paper of a corporation at the first sign= of eroding profitability -- even before they get downgraded. ""You can t wa=it around for a rating agency [to downgrade a company],"" he says.=20Moody s has downgraded five times as many corporations as it has raised so =far this year. Thus, the market for corporate commercial paper has shrunk t=o $1.4 trillion at the end of October, down from $1.6 trillion at the end o=f last year.=20---=20Friday s Credit Markets=20Last week was a brutal time to own Treasurys. The market sold off so sharpl=y as to push yields, which move inversely to prices, almost back up to wher=e they stood before the terrorist attacks. It was the worst bond selloff si=nce 1987, according to economists at Banc One Capital Markets.=20Losses were heaviest in issues like the two-year note, the most sensitive t=o expectations about Federal Reserve policy. Since hitting a record low of =2.30% on Nov. 7, the two-year yield has risen 0.80 percentage point to 3.05=%. In the same period, the 30-year bond yield has risen 0.50 percentage poi=nt to 5.27%.=20At 4 p.m. Friday, the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was down 1 3/32 point=s from late Thursday, or $10.94 per $1,000 face value, at 100 25/32. Its yi=eld jumped to 4.897% from 4.756% Thursday.=20The 30-year Treasury bond s price fell 1 19/32 to 100 25/32 to yield 5.317,= up from 5.211% Thursday.=20Why the selloff? People in the market cite a shift toward the view that the= U.S. economy may finally be on the brink of recovery.

By comparison, the Standard & P=oor s 500-stock index has slumped nearly 14%.Of course, the risks in Russia remain. Despite recent economic gains, the c=ountry still is struggling with a weak banking system, inadequate state ins=titutions to enforce contract laws and few businesses run by the ""modern"" r=ules of corporate governance, according to Samuel Oubadia the 37-year-old m=anager of the Russia fund.=20""But they are getting more open,"" Mr. Oubadia said, though Russia s lax fin=ancial reporting standards are still one of the main roadblocks for foreign= investors.

The Godbole Commit=tee has recently recommended the same for Maharashtra as well.=20Clearly, separating the three functions is a complex restructuring. Maybe i=t helps privatisation, the current fashion on the subject having been set i=n Thatcherite Britain. While some privatisations in UK have succeeded, the =experience has not been consistent all over.Take UK s rail sector. While privatising, the government in its wisdom deci=ded to separate the ownership of the rail network (Railtrack) and the owner=ship and operation of trains. The contractual relationship between the vari=ous operating companies and Railtrack were governed by a byzantine, bewilde=ringly complex system of penalties and incentives, to be monitored by an in=dependent regulator.=20Such separation had no parallel. Besides, Railtrack suffered from poor mana=gement, cost escalation in modernisation of tracks, etc. Several serious ac=cidents occurred and fixing responsibility became difficult. The ""reform"" d=id not work, and Railtrack was put back under public control last month.=20What are the chances of trifurcation of the power sector in India succeedin=g? Pretty poor, if the experience of Orissa is any guide. It faithfully sep=arated the three functions, and privatised distribution and part of generat=ion. AES, a foreign company, was 49 per cent investor in a generating compa=ny, and 51 per cent in CESCO, a distribution company. As Gajendra Haldea an=alysed in this paper on August 27, ""The policy and regulatory framework was= inadequate and myopic.""=20Distribution losses, a euphemism for power theft, were much larger than the= companies had been led to believe at the time of privatisation. CESCO defa=ulted in paying the dues of GRIDCO, the transmission company, which in turn= defaulted to the generating company. Indeed, all CESCO s cash inflows are =now escrowed, leaving it no money even to pay salaries. For all practical p=urposes, the distribution companies seem to be in a difficult situation, pe=rhaps beyond redemption, and the ""reform"" is a total mess.=20The crux of the problem in the power sector is not whether a unified SEB is= less efficient than trifurcated companies it is the political unwillingnes=s to charge a price which covers the cost to all consumers. For a while, cr=oss subsidisation worked with commercial consumers subsidising the househol=d and the agricultural segments.=20However, as the burden became too large, the commercial sector started movi=ng to captive generation, further worsening SEB finances. An ""independent"" =regulator for power tariffs may not solve the problem. He may fix economic =prices but will the state come forward to protect the bill collectors, puni=sh power thiefs, face social unrest if power to recalcitrant consumers is c=ut off? So long as the answers to these questions are in the negative, as, =sadly, they are, the institutional restructuring is no substitute for subst=antive action. No wonder all foreign investors in the power sector want to =get out!=20Enron too wants out but it has many more problems in its home country, over= and above its dispute with MSEB. It had attracted a lot of adverse publici=ty for gouging power consumers in California, a state in a power crisis (se=e World Money, February 2, 2001). The Internet craze also had a hand in Enr=on s misfortunes. It became an energy trader, established an electronic tra=ding platform, had broadband ambitions, went into a disastrous diversificat=ion in water supplies which, if I remember correctly, led to Rebecca Mark s= exit. Perhaps it went into too many areas too quickly under Jeffery Skilli=ng, ex-McKinsey, and was notorious for opaque, complex accounts.=20To top it all, last month it announced that it will take an extraordinary $=1.2 billion charge in its third quarter results for losses in financial act=ivities. Enron s chief financial officer, who was supposed to be in charge =of these, has resigned amidst reports that a private equity fund associated= with him was involved in them. The SEC is investigating the affair and Enr=on s share price is down 67 per cent since mid-October. There are some repo=rts that Shell may make a bid for Enron.=20After its ratings were downgraded, Enron is desperate for liquidity and anx=ious to dispose its assets. DPCL was already on the platter; now a sale has= become even more urgent. Reportedly, Tatas and BSES are interested; so are= the lending institutions. Clearly, if a settlement is to be reached, this =is the optimum time.=20But one is not very optimistic. For one, Delhi and Mumbai will be involved,= and bureaucracies never understand opportunity costs. Our byzantine decisi=on-making processes make timely decisions impossible. Further, if a deal do=es take place, there will be the inevitable allegations of corruption. It i=s much safer for the reputation of the concerned ministers in Mumbai and De=lhi to allow the drift to continue, to ""let the law take its own course"", w=hatever the costs! Sadly, as Jairam Ramesh said in this paper, Indian polit=icians respond to developments only out of compulsion, not conviction.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. =09"

But in the wake of post-agree=ment disclosures by Enron that its future earnings are likely to be substan=tially less than expected, the company s stock has been hammered. In 1 p.m.= trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday, Enron shares fell 30 cen=ts to $4.71. The stock is down 94% so far this year and far short of the pe=r-share takeover price. Dynegy shares rose 64 cents to $40.40.Although Dynegy and Enron both say they are going ahead with the deal under= the terms negotiated, Dynegy does appear to have other options. The agreem=ent with Enron contains a broad ""material adverse change"" clause as well as= some specific trigger points that could be invoked.=20Dynegy officials performed ""due diligence"" throughout the holiday weekend, =seeking to learn more about the intimate workings of Enron, which has suffe=red a series of damaging blows. Since mid-October, Enron has disclosed that= some of its officers participated in personally enriching deals that moved= assets off Enron s balance sheet, for a time, to several private partnersh=ips. Those deals are now the subject of a Securities and Exchange Commissio=n investigation. Past treatment of some of those deals has been termed an ""=accounting error"" by Enron and it twice has rejiggered its earnings since O=ct. 16. At one point, Enron restated downwards nearly five years of earning=s.=20An Enron spokeswoman said the company was proceeding in the belief that the= deal would be completed as agreed. Dynegy spokesman John Sousa said the tw=o sides are forging ahead although he acknowledged that the walk-away provi=sions ""are broad, by design, to ensure adequate protection for Dynegy share=holders."" Shareholders of both firms must still vote on the merger agreemen=t.=20Clauses related to a ""material adverse change,"" also known as a ""material a=dverse effect,"" have been the focus of much attention among merger professi=onals this year, due, in part, to the stock market s fluctuations and the e=conomic slowdown that have caused some buyers to reconsider planned acquisi=tions.=20But such clauses rarely are invoked by a buyer or seller because they are c=onsidered extremely difficult to prove. Both parties typically are reluctan=t to lay out specific terms for canceling a deal, much the way a bride and =groom often balk at negotiating a prenuptial agreement since it appears to =envisage a breakup of the marriage even before it begins.=20Furthermore, a key court case earlier this year affirmed widespread views t=hat a buyer can t easily walk away from a merger. In that case, meat-proces=sing concern Tyson Foods Inc. sought to cancel a planned acquisition of mea=t-packer IBP Inc. due to a drop in IBP s earnings and a write-down of an IB=P subsidiary. But a Delaware judge refused to let Tyson cancel the pact, sa=ying Tyson had been aware of the cyclical nature of IBP s business and the =accounting issue.=20In a lengthy June 18 opinion, Delaware Chancery Court Vice Chancellor Leo E=. Strine Jr. wrote that "" . . . the important thing is whether the company =has suffered a Material Adverse Effect in its business or results of operat=ions that is consequential to the company s earnings power over a commercia=lly reasonable period, which one would think would be measured in years rat=her than months.""=20That interpretation has created ripples in the deal-making community, promp=ting some transactions to include more details about circumstances under wh=ich deals can be terminated. Since the Sept. 11 attacks, for example, a han=dful of merger agreements have specified that future terrorist activity wou=ld qualify as a ""material adverse change,"" or MAC.=20A key issue for any firm alleging there has been a material adverse change =is ""whether the new facts go to the guts of the strategic opportunity or is= it just a hiccup,"" says Meredith Brown, co-chairman of the mergers and acq=uisitions group at law firm Debevoise & Plimpton in New York. He adds that =a court ""may be skeptical"" if Dynegy claimed that Enron s post-merger agree=ment disclosures were a surprise.=20The Enron-Dynegy merger agreement includes several triggers permitting eith=er side to seek termination. Enron can quit the deal if it receives a subst=antially better offer, although it is prohibited from soliciting one. In su=ch a case, it could be required to pay a $350 million ""topper fee"" to Dyneg=y and its co-investor, ChevronTexaco Inc.=20Dynegy can alter the deal if Enron faces ""pending or threatened"" litigation= liabilities that are ""reasonably likely"" to cost Enron $2 billion. If thos=e liabilities hit $3.5 billion ""an Enron material event will be deemed to h=ave occurred,"" presumably allowing Dynegy to call the whole thing off. In s=ome situations, Dynegy would be liable for a $350 million fee, as well.=20Karen Denne, the Enron spokeswoman, said her firm doesn t believe that loss=es arising from the normal course of business would qualify as a material e=vent. The liability must result from litigation. Currently, the company fac=es more than a dozen shareholder suits alleging breach of fiduciary duty by= officers and directors, issuing false and misleading reports and other off=enses.=20Deal makers who aren t involved in the combination say the steep drop in En=ron s stock price since the merger agreement was signed wouldn t by itself =give Dynegy the ability to cancel the pact or force Enron to renegotiate it=s terms. Instead, they say, Dynegy would likely have to prove that Enron s =worsening financial condition was an unanticipated event, which could be di=fficult in light of the company s highly publicized problems and Dynegy s f=requent statement that it clearly understands Enron s businesses. Still, th=ere is another standard clause in the merger document that would allow Dyne=gy to terminate the deal if ""any representation or warranty of Enron shall =have become untrue.""=20Other energy companies have abandoned deals following a widening gap in sto=ck prices that changed an acquisition premium. Western Resources Inc. of To=peka, Kansas last week sued Public Service Co. of New Mexico seeking hundre=ds of millions of dollars in damages after it failed to buy Western s utili=ties. The lawsuit accused Public Service of breaching its ""duty of good fai=th and fair dealing"" and said the New Mexico company tried to ""sabotage"" th=e deal as the two companies  stock prices diverged. Public Service denies t=he accusations.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Despite a $35 billion merger completed in Octobe=r, ChevronTexaco Corp. is still not one of the oil superpowers. Nor, at mor=e than $90 billion a year in revenues, is it a scrappy little guy. So Chair=man David J. O Reilly has been searching for a strategy beyond just drillin=g for more oil and gas.=20Now, he may have something: a big stake in the No. 1 energy-trading company=. Chevron Corp. has owned 26% of Dynegy Inc. since 1996, and with Dynegy s =planned acquisition of Enron Corp., the top energy trader, ChevronTexaco is= making the oil industry s most aggressive push yet into this fast-growing =business. It plans to eventually pump $2.5 billion into the combined Dynegy= and Enron to maintain its 26% stake, and it might raise that share. So, wh=ile ChevronTexaco s much bigger rivals run small in-house trading operation=s, energy trading may soon account for more than 10% of ChevronTexaco s ear=nings. ``Chevron is now positioned to be a leader in the business,   says a=nalyst Arjun Murti at Goldman, Sachs & Co.The deal would certainly dovetail with ChevronTexaco s strategy of becoming= a more integrated energy company, with a hand in everything from pumping o=il at the wellhead to trading natural-gas futures. By acquiring Texaco, Che=vron picked up, for instance, a big refining-and-marketing business --which= should balance out the bad times in oil and gas production, says Eugene No=wak, an analyst at ABN Amro. ``When crude-oil prices are down, they ll have= margin improvements on refining and marketing,   he says. O Reilly and oth=er ChevronTexaco executives declined to comment.=20Until now, Dynegy wasn t a big deal for Chevron. Chevron purchased the stak=e for $700 million when Dynegy was still called NGC Corp., and it filled th=ree of the 14 board seats--positions it will keep. Since then, Chevron has =sold nearly all its domestic natural-gas production to Dynegy. The stake ha=s been a good investment: it is now worth $3 billion, ChevronTexaco says.==20Sitting on $2.9 billion in cash as of the end of the second quarter, Chevro=nTexaco can well afford the Dynegy deal, analysts say. And they expect O Re=illy to use some of that to make more buys; the most likely target is a nat=ural-gas company. Maybe it s not so bad being No. 4.Illustration: Chart: CHEVRON S GROWING CASH HOARD=20Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

CEO Charles L. Watson if he had sat= back and gloated. After all, Watson had watched as his bigger, brasher cro=sstown rival sniffed at Dynegy s more cautious strategy, all the while garn=ering most of the credit for reshaping the energy-trading business.=20Instead, Watson picked up the phone on Oct. 24 and called Enron Chairman, C=EO, and longtime acquaintance Kenneth L. Lay to ask how he could help. Lay =didn t respond immediately, but as Enron s stock continued to plunge and th=e company faced a cash squeeze, it became clear what the only realistic ans=wer could be: Bail us out.So two days later, Lay invited Watson to his River Oaks home near downtown =Houston for breakfast to discuss a deal. Over muffins and ``a bad cup of co=ffee   the next day, Watson recalls, they sketched the outlines, and by 10 =p.m. that night, the investment bankers were called in. On Nov. 9, Dynegy a=nnounced that it would pay about $10 billion, plus the assumption of $13 bi=llion in debt, to buy Enron, which is nearly four times its size. The key t=o the deal was Dynegy s immediate $1.5 billion infusion of cash to shore up= Enron s balance sheet and save its credit rating. The money came from Dyne=gy s 26% owner, ChevronTexaco Corp.=20Without that help, Enron--the seventh-largest U.S. company, based on its $1=00 billion in sales last year--may well have faced bankruptcy. Watson says =that he never would have imagined such an outcome in his wildest dreams. ``=I don t think anybody foresaw the problems [at Enron],   he says. ``It s be=en incredible to watch.  =20Watson, 51, has to make good on what may well be his riskiest investment ye=t. If he can pull it off, the new Dynegy will have revenues of more than $2=00 billion and $90 billion in assets, including more than 22,000 megawatts =of power-generating capacity and 25,000 miles of pipeline. It would control= an estimated 20% to 25% of the energy-trading market, up from about 6% now=.=20That would be sweet vindication for Watson s strategy. Dynegy backs trading= operations with hard assets such as power plants, which allows the company= to guarantee a supply of electricity to a buyer. In contrast, Enron has wo=rked furiously to shed power plants and oil- and gas-generating fields, bel=ieving it could earn higher returns using its trading and technology expert=ise to tap assets owned by others in markets including steel, pulp, and pap=er. IRRESISTIBLE BARGAIN. As Enron s stock slid below $9 from its August, 2=000, high of $90, it became a bargain that Watson couldn t pass up. It woul=d have taken years for Dynegy to build up a market-making operation to matc=h Enron s. Its risk-management systems are top-of-the-line. Enron s commerc=ial-services unit, which manages power supplies for corporate customers suc=h as Wendy s International Inc., is three or four years ahead of Dynegy s, =says Steve Bergstrom, president of Dynegy. Watson says he still plans to ge=t rid of the $8 billion worth of assets Lay had earmarked for sale, includi=ng the Portland (Ore.) General Electric plant and oil and gas assets in Ind=ia. For the $1.5 billion, though, if the deal falls through Dynegy will hav=e the right to Enron s prized Northern Natural Gas pipeline, worth an estim=ated $2.25 billion. And Dynegy can walk away if Enron s legal liabilities e=xceed $3.5 billion.=20Watson firmly believes that Enron suffered from a crisis of confidence, not= a meltdown of its core business. Indeed, Enron s wholesale-trading operati=on earned $2.3 billion last year. Says Watson: ``We know the business. We l=ooked under the hood, and guess what? It s just as strong as we thought it =was.  =20But the trading profits were obscured in recent weeks by Enron s accounting= tricks. The biggest danger for Watson is that there are other time bombs t=icking away. Already, the company has slashed its reported earnings since 1=997 by $591 million, or 20% of its total, to account for controversial part=nerships involving Enron officials. The Securities & Exchange Commission is= still investigating. ``We believe it will take more than just a couple of =weeks and a long-term relationship [between Watson and Lay] to do all the n=ecessary due diligence,   says analyst Carol Coale of Prudential Securities= Inc. Dynegy s Bergstrom counters: ``We re pretty certain that most everyth=ing of material consideration has been disclosed.   If not? The massive ear=nings boost provides ``a high margin of error,   he says. A WANNABE. Of cou=rse, regulators may object to the concentration of trading operations. And =Watson will have to mesh two very different cultures. Enron is known for it=s intense, even cutthroat entrepreneurial spirit. Dynegy s operations are m=ore conservative; some compare it to a fraternity. Dynegy s decision to iss=ue new stock options to some Enron employees may soothe battered egos. It s=hould help, too, that Lay decided not to take the $60 million golden parach=ute he could have received in a buyout. As it is, Lay will not have a manag=ement job with the new company.=20Dynegy often seemed to be an Enron wannabe, following it into online tradin=g and commercial services. Still, Dynegy s 361% stock gains last year eclip=sed Enron s 87% rise, and it rankled some that Lay s execs got more credit.= ``Chuck Watson may not have been in the spotlight, but he has always been =at the forefront of this business,   says Bruce M.

Here s what companies should do-=-and what investors need to knowBy Nanette Byrnes and David Henry=20With Mike McNamee in Washington11/26/2001BusinessWeek76(Copyright 2001 McGraw-Hill, Inc.)In an age when giant earnings write-offs have become commonplace, it s hard= to shock Wall Street. But on Nov. 8, Enron Corp. managed to do it. After y=ears of high-octane growth that had seen earnings surge by up to 24% a year=, the Houston-based energy company acknowledged that results for the past t=hree years were actually overstated by more than a half-billion dollars. It= was confirmation of investors  worst fears. Three weeks earlier, Enron had= announced a big drop in shareholders  equity, sparking fears that its hide=ously complex financial statements were distorting its true performance. Ma=nagement pointed to a number of factors, including a dubious decision to ex=clude the results of three partnerships from its financial statements and a= billion-dollar error several years earlier that had inflated the company s= net worth.=20Enron may be an extreme example of a company whose performance fell far sho=rt of the glowing picture painted by management in its earnings releases, b=ut it is hardly alone. This year, Corporate America is expected to charge o=ff a record $125 billion, much of it for assets, investments, and inventory= that aren t worth as much as management thought (chart, page 79). Even if =companies don t go back and restate earnings, as Enron is doing, those char=ges cast doubt on the record-breaking earnings growth of the late  90s.Not since the 1930s has the quality of corporate earnings been such an issu=e--and so difficult for investors to determine. There s more at stake than =the fortunes of those who bought shares based on misleading numbers. If eve=n the most sophisticated financial minds can t figure out what a company ac=tually earns, that has implications far beyond Enron. U.S. financial market=s have a reputation for integrity that took decades to build. It has made t=he U.S. the gold standard for financial reporting and the preeminent place =to invest. It has also ensured ready access to capital for U.S. corporation=s. That a company such as Enron, a member of the Standard & Poor s 500-stoc=k index and one of the largest companies on the New York Stock Exchange, co=uld fall so far so fast shows how badly that gold standard has been tarnish=ed. ``The profession of auditing and accounting is, in fact, in crisis,   s=ays Paul A. Volcker, former chairman of the Federal Reserve and now one of =the leaders of the International Accounting Standards Board.=20Sometimes, as in the case of Enron, fuzzy numbers result from questionable =decisions in figuring net earnings. More often, though, the earnings chaos =results from a disturbing trend among companies to calculate profits in the=ir own idiosyncratic ways--and an increasing willingness among investors an=d analysts to accept those nonstandard tallies, which appear under a variet=y of names, from ``pro forma   to ``core.   (Enron offers its own such vers=ion. Before investors untangled the importance of Enron s first announcemen=t, its stock rose briefly because it told investors that its ``recurring ne=t income   had met expectations.) The resulting murk makes it difficult to =answer the most basic question in investing: What did my company earn?=20Why calculate a second set of earnings in the first place? Because the numb=ers reached by applying generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) are= woefully inadequate when it comes to giving investors a good sense of a co=mpany s prospects. Many institutional investors, most Wall Street analysts,= and even many accountants say GAAP is irrelevant. ``I don t know anyone wh=o uses GAAP net income anymore for anything,   says Lehman Brothers Inc. ac=counting expert Robert Willens. The problem is that GAAP includes a lot of =noncash charges and one-time expenses. While investors need to be aware of =those charges, they also need a number that pertains solely to the performa=nce of ongoing operations.=20That s what operating earnings are supposed to do. But because they re calc=ulated in an ad hoc manner, with each company free to use its own rules, co=mparisons between companies have become meaningless. ``No investor--certain=ly not any ordinary investor--can read these in a way that s useful,   says= Harvey L. Pitt, chairman of the Securities & Exchange Commission. The SEC =is examining whether new rules are needed to clarify financial reports and =perhaps restrict use of pro formas.=20What s badly needed is a set of rules for calculating operating earnings an=d a requirement to make clear how they relate to net income. In the end, in=vestors need two numbers--a standardized operating number and an audited ne=t-income number--and a clear explanation of how to get from one to the othe=r. ``OUT OF HAND.   A widespread consensus is building to do just that. In =early November, S&P proposed a set of rules for companies to follow when ta=llying operating earnings. Only the week before, the Financial Accounting S=tandards Board, the rulemakers for GAAP, had announced that they, too, woul=d be taking up this issue. Volcker says the International Accounting Standa=rds Board is also seeking a uniform definition of operating earnings.=20``Over the past two or three years, the use of creative earnings measures h=as grown and grown and grown to the point where it has really gotten out of= hand,   says David M. Blitzer, S&P s chief investment strategist. ``Earnin=gs are one of the key measures that anybody looks at when they re trying to= evaluate a company. If people want to use an operating-earnings measure, w=e better all know what we re looking at.  =20Without those standards in place, the gap between earnings according to gen=erally accepted accounting principles and earnings according to Wall Street= is only going to grow wider and more confusing. Look at the variance in ea=rnings per share calculated for the S&P 500 for the third quarter: It s $10=.78 according to Wall Street analysts as tallied by Thomson Financial/First= Call, $9.17 according to S&P, and $6.37 according to numbers reported to t=he SEC under GAAP. (S&P, like BusinessWeek, is owned by The McGraw-Hill Com=panies.)=20The lack of a standard measure can be costly to those who choose wrong. Use= First Call s earnings for the past four quarters and you get a relatively =modest price-earnings ratio of 23 for the S&P 500. But run the numbers usin=g GAAP earnings, and suddenly the market has a far steeper p-e of 38.=20How did we get into this mess? Investors and analysts have been calculating= operating earnings for years, and for years, reasonable people could more =or less agree on how to do it. Then came the dot-com bubble, along with inc=reased pressure from Wall Street for companies to meet their quarterly earn=ings forecasts. Suddenly, companies that hadn t turned a profit by any conv=entional measure started offering ever more inventive earnings variants. Th=ese customized pro forma calculations excluded a grab bag of expenses and a=llowed upstart companies to show a profit. ``TOWER OF BABEL.   Pro forma fo=rmulas vary wildly from company to company and even from quarter to quarter= within the same company, casting doubt on their validity. And these days, =the gulf between net earnings and pro forma earnings is wider than ever. S&=P s tallies fall between the two: S&P s numbers are more systematic than pr=o forma, but they aren t followed widely enough to be a standard. ``Investo=rs are facing a Tower of Babel,   says Robert K. Elliott, former chief of t=he American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) and a retired= KPMG partner. ``It s not standardized, and the numbers are not audited.  ==20That makes it tough to evaluate a company s performance. In the quarter end=ed on Sept. 30, Nortel Networks Corp. offered shareholders at least three e=arnings numbers to choose from. By conservative GAAP accounting, the teleco=mmunications giant lost $1.08 a share. The company also provided two possib=le pro forma options: a 68 cents loss that excluded ``special charges,   in=cluding some acquisition costs and restructuring charges, and a still bette=r 27 cents loss that further excluded $1.9 billion of ``incremental charges=,   such as writing down inventories and increasing provisions for receivab=les. Wall Street chose the rosiest one.=20Confusing? You bet. Companies defend their pro forma calculations by pointi=ng out that they re merely filling a void: Investors are clamoring for a me=asure that gives them better insight into their company s future. The goal =is to get to the core of the business and try to measure the outlook for th=ose operations. ``There are good reasons why there is an emphasis on operat=ing earnings,   says Volcker. ``It is an effort to provide some continuity =and some reflection of the underlying progress of the company.   Besides, a=s companies like to point out, they still have to report GAAP earnings, and= investors are free to ignore everything else.=20There s no starker lesson in the shortcomings of GAAP than the $50 billion =asset write-downs by JDS Uniphase Corp., the biggest charge of the year. Ne=ar the height of the telecom bull market in July, 2000, the San Jose (Calif=.) maker of fiber optics topped off a buying spree by acquiring competitor =SDL Inc. for $41 billion in stock. When the deal closed in February, its as=sets ballooned from $25 billion to $65 billion. But by then, shares of JDS =and other fiber-optics makers were collapsing. To bring its acquisitions in=to line with their new value, the company took charges of $50 billion. Desp=ite the fact that the bulk of its losses stemmed from stock transactions an=d involved no cash paid, GAAP required that the charges be taken out of net= income. So according to GAAP, JDS lost $56 billion in the fiscal year endi=ng in June--a staggering figure for a company whose revenues over the past =five years added up to only $5 billion.=20Analysts and the company argue that besides not involving cash, the charge-=off was all about the past, a right-sizing of values that had gotten out of= hand. To analyze the company s prospects, they excluded the $50 billion ch=arge. ``The accounting is not designed to make things look better but to de=scribe what happened,   says JDS Uniphase Chief Financial Officer Anthony R=. Muller, ``and we ll live with the consequences, whatever they are.   Anal=ysts make a similar defense. ``My goal is to figure out what the business i=s going to produce so that we can value the company,   says Lehman Brothers= analyst Arnab Chanda. GLACIAL PACE. Are JDS s pro forma numbers realistic-=-a fair gauge of JDS s ongoing operations? Right now, it s hard for investo=rs to judge. And that s the kind of ambiguity S&P and others would like to =eliminate. In November, S&P circulated a memo on how to standardize operati=ng earnings. Under the proposal, operating earnings would include the costs= of purchases, research and development, restructuring costs (including sev=erance), write-downs from ongoing operations, and the cost to the company o=f stock options. It would exclude merger-and-acquisition expenses, impairme=nt of goodwill, litigation settlements, and the gain or loss on the sale of= an asset.=20When S&P applied roughly that formula to JDS Uniphase, it split the differe=nce between Wall Street and GAAP. Because of differences in what each group= included in their earnings calculations, the results were chaotic. Using G=AAP, the company lost $9.39 a share. S&P figures it lost $3.19, while the c=ompany put the loss at 36 cents. Meanwhile, Wall Street says it made 2 cent=s.=20The S&P standard may make sense, but it raises the question: Where is the F=inancial Accounting Standards Board, the group in charge of GAAP? Chairman =Edmund L. Jenkins says FASB will be addressing the problems. Still, investo=rs shouldn t expect any improvement soon. The pace of change at FASB tends =to be glacial. It typically takes four years to complete a new standard. In= 1996, for example, the board realized that standards on restructuring char=ges had some big loopholes and it resolved to put the issue on its agenda. =In June, 2000, the board finally issued a draft of a new standard, asked fo=r comments, and held a public hearing. In October, 2001, the board said it =still wasn t ready to put a fix in place. Now, the recession has set off an=other wave of restructuring charges, and the FASB still doesn t have new ru=les.=20The slow pace means the standard-setters sometimes fail to react to sudden =changes in the market. The most recent failure followed the terrorist attac=ks on September 11. An FASB task force, unable to come up with a set of rul=es for separating September 11 costs from general expenses, instead told co=mpanies that the disaster could not be treated as an extraordinary item. So= GAAP earnings include costs stemming from the disaster as part of a compan=y s general performance. Many companies have nevertheless broken those cost=s out in their unaudited press releases.=20Many more are likely to do so in the fourth quarter. Indeed, 2001 is shapin=g up to be one for the record books. A poor economy and the devastating aft=ereffects of September 11 have resulted in a slew of unusual charges that a=re unlikely to recur and that no one could have foreseen. But there s a gro=wing concern that the earnings fog is providing managers with cover to hide= missteps of the past within that vast category of supposedly one-time char=ges. The temptation will be to take as big a charge as possible now, while =investors are braced for bad news. Not only can managers sweep away yesterd=ay s errors, but tomorrow s earnings will look even better.=20The basic question comes down to what constitutes a special expense--a char=ge so unusual that to include it in the earnings calculation would be to di=stort the truth about a company s performance. Usually, big charges fall in=to a few categories, including charges for laying off workers and restructu=ring a company, charges for assets that have lost value since they were pur=chased, charges for investments that have lost value, and charges for inven=tory that has become obsolete. In a recent study, Harvard Business School p=rofessor Mark T. Bradshaw found that companies are increasingly calling the=se charges unusual. That gives them a rationale for excluding them from the=ir pro forma calculations.=20Lots of critics disagree, saying such charges are often an inevitable part =of the business cycle and should be reflected in a company s earnings histo=ry. They certainly should not be ignored by investors. ``Charges are real s=hareholder wealth that s been lost,   argues David W. Tice, manager of the =Prudent Bear Fund, a mutual fund with a pessimistic bent that s up 17% so f=ar this year. ``It s money they spent on something no longer worth what it =was, a correction of past earnings, or a reserve for costs moving forward. =Whatever the reason, it s a real cost to the company, and that hurts shareh=olders.   Without standards, excessive write-offs from operating earnings c=an obscure actual performance. Without any rules, companies calculate opera=ting earnings inconsistently in order to put their companies in the best po=ssible light. Dell Computer Corp. is a good example of this ``heads I win, =tails you lose   school of accounting. For years, Dell benefited from gains= in its venture-capital investments and was happy to include those gains in= its reported earnings, where they appeared as a separate line on the incom=e statement. But this year, when those gains turned to losses, the computer= maker issued pro forma numbers that excluded that $260 million drag. Dell =spokesman Michael Maher says the company s press releases and SEC filings b=reak out investment income and give GAAP numbers as well as pro forma. ``In= our view, the numbers are reported clearly,   says Maher. ``It s all out t=here for the consuming public.   PAST PUFFERY. Many experts believe special= charges are a sign that past performance was exaggerated. What should inve=stors make of a company such as Gateway Inc.? Two restructuring charges in =the first and third quarters, minus a small extraordinary gain, totaled $1.=12 billion, or about $100 million more than the company made in 1998, 1999,= and 2000 combined. Which is the truer picture of its performance and poten=tial? The write-offs or the earnings? Write-offs for customer financing are= another example. When Nortel increased its reserves for credit extended to= customers by $767 million in September, it effectively admitted it had boo=ked sales in the past to companies that couldn t pay--in effect overstating= its performance in those earlier periods. In addition, Nortel says booking= sales and accounting for credit are unrelated issues. Tech companies blame= the sharp downturn in their industry for the big write-offs. And these are=n t isolated examples. Peter L. Bernstein, publisher of newsletter Economic=s & Portfolio Strategy, found that from 1989 to 1993, 20% of earnings vanis=hed into write-offs.=20Big charge-offs can also distort future performance. Critics contend that e=xcess reserves are often used as a sort of ``cookie jar   from which earnin=gs can be taken in future quarters to meet Wall Street s expectations. Or c=harges taken this year, for example, which is apt to be a lousy one for mos=t companies anyway, might include costs that would otherwise have been take=n in future periods. Prepaying those costs gives a big boost to later earni=ngs. Rules for figuring operating earnings would help, but this is an area =that will always involve a certain amount of judgment--and therefore invite= a certain amount of abuse. ``People are going to write off everything they= can in the next two quarters because they re having a bad year anyway,   s=ays Robert G. Atkins, a Mercer Management consultant.=20Part of the lure of big special charges is that investors tend to shrug the=m off, believing that with the bad news out in the open, the company is poi=sed for a brighter future. Since Gateway detailed its third-quarter charge =of $571 million on Oct. 18, Wall Street has bid the stock up 48%, compared =with a 6% runup for the S&P 500.=20Often, though, investors should take exactly the opposite message. If, for =example, part of a restructuring involves slashing employee training, infor=mation-technology spending, or research and development, the cuts could dep=ress future performance, says Baruch Lev, a professor of accounting at the =Stern School of Business at New York University. ``Are these really one-tim=e events?   he asks. ``Or is this the beginning of an avalanche?   Indeed, =Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co. strategist Steve Galbraith has found that =in the year following a big charge-off to earnings companies have underperf=ormed the stock market by 20 percentage points. ``LA LA LAND.   Investors a=re apt to be faced with more huge write-offs next year, even if the economy= doesn t continue to worsen. Why? The transition to a new GAAP rule that ch=anges the way companies account for goodwill--a balance-sheet asset that re=flects the amount paid for an acquisition over the net value of the tangibl=e assets. Under the new rule, companies will have to assess their propertie=s periodically and decrease their worth on the balance sheet if their value= falls. An informal survey by Financial Executives International of its mem=ber controllers and financial officers found that at least a third expect t=o take more charges.=20But figuring out the proper value of those assets is no easy task. Unless t=here is a comparable company or factory with an established market price, v=aluing them involves a lot of guesswork for which there are no firm rules. =``What this is really coming down to is corporations and their auditors com=ing up with their own tests for impairment,   says the Stern School s Profe=ssor Paul R. Brown. ``It s La La Land.  =20While the tidal wave of special charges is providing cover for earnings gam=es, it could also be an impetus for change--especially in the wake of the d=ot-com fiasco. Indeed, there are some signs of a backlash. The real estate =investment trust industry was a pioneer of engineered earnings, with its ``=funds from operations,   or FFO. But now some REITs have begun to revert to= plain old GAAP earnings. Hamid R. Moghadam, CEO of San Francisco-based AMB= Property Corp., shifted back to GAAP in 1999. ``The reason I don t like FF=O is very simple,   says Moghadam. ``One company s numbers look better than= another one s even if they had identical fundamental results.  =20There are other steps FASB could take to improve financial reporting and re=store GAAP s status. Trevor S. Harris, an accounting expert at Morgan Stanl=ey, says it could force companies to make clear distinctions between income= from operations and income from financial transactions. Lehman s Willens s=ays companies should provide more information on cash expenses and how they= bear on earnings. An easy step would be to require companies to file their= press releases with the SEC.=20At the least, says Lev, companies must clearly explain how their pro forma =numbers relate to the GAAP numbers. Otherwise, he says, investors ``see num=bers floating there, and where did they come from?   In today s environment= of unregulated pro forma calculations and supersize write-offs, no questio=n is more important to investors.High-Gloss GlossaryCompanies are using a variety of accounting practices to put the best spin =ontheir results. Here s what those terms mean:DEFINING EARNINGS:NET INCOMEThe bottom line, according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAA=P).Sometimes called ``reported earnings,   these are the numbers the Securitie=s &Exchange Commission accepts in its filings.OPERATING EARNINGSAn adjustment of net income that excludes certain costs deemed to be unrela=tedto the ongoing business. Although it sounds deceptively like a GAAP figurecalled ``operating income   (revenue minus the costs of doing business), it= isnot an audited figure.CORE EARNINGSAnother term for operating earnings. Neither core nor operating earnings ar=ecalculated according to set rules. They can include or exclude anything thepreparer wishes.PRO FORMA EARNINGSThe 1990s term for operating earnings. Popularized by dot-coms, it sometime=sexcludes such basic costs as marketing and interest.EBITDAEarnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. Thegranddaddy of pro forma, it was initially highlighted by industries thatcarried high debt loads, such as cable TV, but has since come to be widelyquoted.ADJUSTED EARNINGSA new term for pro forma.DEFINING COSTS:SPECIAL CHARGESA general term for anything a company wants to highlight as unusual andtherefore to be excluded from future earnings projections.ASSET IMPAIRMENTSCharges taken to bring something a company paid a high price for down to it=scurrent market value. Many companies are now taking these charges on intern=alventure-capital funds that bought Internet and other high-tech stocks atinflated prices.GOODWILL IMPAIRMENTSThe same idea as asset impairments except they re used to write down thepremium a company paid over the fair market value of the net tangible asset=sacquired. These charges will explode in the first quarter of 2002 because o=f achange in mergers-and-acquisitions accounting that eliminates goodwillamortization and requires holdings to be carried at no more than fair value=s.RESTRUCTURING RESERVESAn accrued expense (not usually cash) to cover future costs of closing down= aportion of a business, a plant, or of firings. These are projected costs an=dif overstated can later become a boost to earnings as they are reversed.WRITE-DOWNLowering the value of an asset, such as a plant or stock investment. It isoften excused as a bookkeeping exercise, but there may have been a real cos=tlong ago that now proves ill spent, or there may have been associated cashcosts, such as investment-banking fees.Illustration: Chart: THE BIG BATH CHART BY ERIC HOFFMANN/BW=20Illustration: Chart: EARNINGS CHAOS CHART BY ERIC HOFFMANN/BW=20Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Or do you think it s just that people s per=ceptions about risk have changed?=20I ve been investing since 1959, and I have to say that, year after year, th=e risk hasn t changed. The risk is always there. There s risk in investing =in stocks, bonds and even U.S. Treasuries because of interest-rate [fluctua=tions]. There s risk in real estate, too.=20So the question is: How do you handle it? The best way is to diversify. Ove=r a long period of time, people who diversify their investments do pretty d=arned well. When they don t . . . sometimes it s fatal. If the only stock a=n investor owned was Enron . . . or Cisco at 70, that was pretty fatal.=20What do you say to people who say they re too scared to invest right now?

It is a sign that investors are willing to pay a rich price f=or option protection and expect the stock to be unsettled as the Houston co=mpany sorts through its credit and debt problems and seeks to calm frazzled= investors.=20Enron near-month defensive puts traded heavily in an otherwise quiet sessio=n Wednesday, as investors bought them to hedge. The December 5 puts traded =more than 10,000 contracts and jumped 45 cents to $1.10 at the Chicago Boar=d Options Exchange. The stock closed down $1.98, or 28%, to $5.01, as of 4 =p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.Enron s calls traded actively as some investors sold them to generate incom=e. Traders noted some call buying -- especially after Enron procured a thre=e-week extension on a $690 million note -- as some hopeful investors bet on= Enron pulling through its troubles and proceeding with its merger with Dyn=egy Inc. Enron s December 5 calls traded more than 14,500 contracts, compar=ed with open interest of 710, as they fell $1.45 to $1.15 at the CBOE.=20For investors who want to book a tax loss on beaten-down stocks, the ""wash =sale"" rule can be a hurdle, because it essentially prevents taxpayers from =selling stock or securities at a loss and then reacquiring ""substantially i=dentical"" securities within a 30-day period before or after that loss. This= poses a problem for those who want to book a loss yet own stocks whose pri=ces now make them attractive ""buy"" candidates.=20In addition, the Internal Revenue Service has taken the position that the w=ash-sale rule will disallow a loss if the investor sells an in-the-money pu=t, because there is a strong likelihood that stock will be put to or acquir=ed by the investor.=20So investors typically get around the wash-sale rule by ""doubling up"": buyi=ng additional stock or options, waiting at least 31 days, and then selling =the original stock to book the loss. Investors double up by buying calls, w=hich locks a price to buy stock and achieves the same effect as buying addi=tional stock.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

EmshwillerStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal11/23/2001The Wall Street JournalA3(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)Even as it reiterated its intention to purchase Enron Corp., Dynegy Inc. is= coming under increasing pressure to renegotiate or walk away from the mult=ibillion-dollar deal.=20The pressure is stemming from the continuing slide in the price of Enron sh=ares and the mounting financial problems at the Houston energy-trading comp=any, the nation s biggest marketer of electricity and natural gas. During t=he past month, Enron has taken a $1 billion write-off of assets, revised do=wnward the earnings of the past several years and taken a $1.2 billion redu=ction in shareholder equity.The problems have been due largely to dealings Enron had with private partn=erships, run by some of its own executives, under investigation by the Secu=rities and Exchange Commission. In an SEC filing Monday, Enron disclosed hu=ndreds of millions of potential additional write-offs as well as the possib=ility that its weakening financial condition could force it to repay more t=han $2 billion in loans by the end of the year.=20As of 4 p.m. Wednesday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron =shares fell $1.98, or 28%, to $5.01 each after having dropped 23% Tuesday. =In excess of 115 million shares traded Wednesday, more than four times the =volume of any other Big Board stock. Enron s bonds also again traded sharpl=y lower, market observers said.=20The turmoil spilled over to Dynegy s stock, which also was among the most a=ctively traded on the New York Stock Exchange. As of 4 p.m. Wednesday, Dyne=gy shares fell $1.94 to $39.76 each.=20On Wednesday, Dynegy issued a statement in which Chairman and Chief Executi=ve Chuck Watson said his company was working ""to accelerate the regulatory =approvals required to complete the merger in accordance with the previously= announced agreement"" though it continued to perform ""due diligence"" on Enr=on.=20Under the merger agreement, Dynegy has opportunities to renegotiate or walk= away from the deal if Enron s financial and legal problems become severe e=nough. However, some observers said it can be difficult to invoke these so-=called material adverse change clauses. They point to a decision earlier th=is year by a Delaware Chancery Court judge who forced Tyson Foods Inc. to c=omplete a planned purchase of IBP Inc. even though Tyson, a Springdale, Ark=., food-products company, had wanted to cancel the transaction because of a= drop in IBP s earnings and accounting problems at an IBP unit.=20Dynegy officials didn t return calls seeking comment. To complete the deal,= two-thirds of Dynegy shareholders and a majority of Enron shareholders wou=ld have to give their approval. No dates for those votes have been set.=20One person familiar with the merger plans said the SEC filing Monday by Enr=on contained information Dynegy hadn t known about. Dynegy representatives =planned to work through the weekend evaluating the importance of this new i=nformation as part of the company s due diligence, this person said. It cou=ldn t be determined what the new information was.=20The merger agreement, announced Nov. 9, calls for Dynegy to exchange 0.2685= share for each of Enron s roughly 850 million fully diluted shares, giving= the purchase a value of about $9 billion at Dynegy s current stock price. =However, from a price standpoint, the deal is appearing less attractive to =Dynegy.=20On the day of the merger announcement, Enron shares were trading at about $=8.63 each, or about 83% of the purchase price under the exchange ratio. As =of Wednesday, Enron s market price was only about 47% of the merger-formula= price. Such a sharp deterioration is unusual following a merger announceme=nt, when the stock price of the company being acquired generally begins tra=ding relatively close to the offering price.=20Sentiment among Wall Street analysts also is turning against the merger. In=itially, many analysts lauded the merger as a move that would rescue Enron =and provide a major boost to Houston-based Dynegy. Dynegy and Enron officia=ls have predicted that the merger, supposed to be completed late next year,= would significantly and immediately increase Dynegy s earnings.=20Now analysts are challenging that assumption. Ron Barone, managing director= at UBS Warburg LLC, said he believes that because of Enron s financial pro=blems, a combined company would actually have lower earnings next year than= Dynegy would have by itself. Mr. Barone said he thinks a ""likely scenario""= is that the merger formula will be renegotiated sharply down to about 0.15= Dynegy share for each Enron share.=20Such a ratcheting down wouldn t be without precedent in the deal. According= to one person familiar with the merger negotiations, Dynegy reduced the ex=change formula at least once prior to the Nov. 9 announcement because of En=ron s rapidly sinking stock price, which at the beginning of this year was =above $80 a share.=20In perhaps the most significant sign of the turning tide on Wall Street, Go=ldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer lowered his ratings on Enron and Dynegy=. A longtime Enron fan, Mr. Fleischer issued a report expressing doubts tha=t the merger would help Dynegy s earnings and whether Enron could ""recover =the significant business that has been lost"" in its giant energy-trading op=erations. ""The Enron machine continues to sputter,"" Mr. Fleischer wrote.=20Some observers say that if Dynegy walked away from the deal or tried to ren=egotiate the terms significantly, Enron might be pushed into a bankruptcy-l=aw filing. Without the Dynegy acquisition and continued support from its ba=nkers and customers, an Enron bankruptcy-court filing ""is highly possible,""= said Ralph Pellecchia, a senior director at Fitch, a credit-ratings agency=. On Wednesday, Fitch maintained its credit rating on Enron at just one not=ch above noninvestment-grade, or ""junk,"" status. But Fitch also said it bel=ieved Enron s trading partners had made ""significant cash collateral calls""= in recent days that are ""well in excess of previous expectations,"" contrib=uting to ""liquidity pressures.""=20Among the advisers Enron has hired during its current crisis is the law fir=m of Weil, Gotshal & Manges, which specializes in bankruptcy and corporate-=workout situations. Asked about a possible bankruptcy filing, an Enron spok=eswoman said the company expects the Dynegy deal to go through and therefor=e doesn t expect to have to look at alternatives to the merger. Since the m=erger announcement, Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay has said his company had alt=ernatives to the Dynegy deal but he has declined to identify them. Enron sa=id it made some progress improving its financial position. The company said= it reached a final agreement with units of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Cit=igroup Inc. on the remaining $450 million of a previously announced $1 bill=ion in secured credit lines. Enron said lenders had agreed to extend repaym=ent of an existing $690 million note to mid-December from next week. The sp=okeswoman said a restructuring of that obligation is expected to be complet=ed next month so that repayment wouldn t be required this year.=20---=20Thaddeus Herrick and Robin Sidel contributed to this article.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Amid growing disclosur=es of financial problems in recent weeks, the company ""locked down"" the ret=irement plan from Oct. 17 to Nov. 19 to make administrative changes, which =prevented employees from selling Enron shares as the share price collapsed.Enron, which recently agreed to be acquired by Dynegy Inc., Houston, becaus=e of mounting financial problems, has seen its stock price fall to $5.01 on= Wednesday from a peak of nearly $90 a share last year. The decline has bee=n costly to participants in Enron s retirement plan because more than 60% o=f the 401(k) assets were invested in Enron shares at the end of last year, =according to one of the suits.=20The first suit was filed Nov. 13 on behalf of plan participants by Campbell= Harrison & Wright LLP, a Houston law firm, and the second was filed Tuesda=y by Seattle-based Hagens Berman LLP. Both seek class-action certification.==20Enron said its corporate policy is not to comment on pending lawsuits. A sp=okeswoman also said the company s 401(k) plan offers participants 18 invest=ment choices, one of which is company stock.=20The company s stock has fallen amid mounting losses and disclosures that it= had extensive off-balance-sheet dealings with a web of partnerships headed= by former company officials. The Securities and Exchange Commission has la=unched a formal investigation into the company s accounting, and Enron has =said it will restate years of financial information.=20The suits against Enron are the latest of a series of suits filed against c=ompanies over losses in the company-stock portion of their 401(k) plans. Th=e suits allege the plan trustees breached their fiduciary duties by continu=ing to offer company stock, even after they became aware of serious busines=s problems that would hurt the stock price. All the suits are pending.=20As with most of these companies, Enron matches employee contributions to th=e 401(k) with shares of Enron stock, and also offers Enron stock as an inve=stment choice, in addition to a variety of mutual funds. About $1.3 billion= of the plan s $2.1 billion in assets was invested in Enron shares at the e=nd of 2000, according to the suit filed by Campbell Harrison.=20Pamela Tittle, a participant in the 401(k) plan who worked in the finance d=epartment and a named plaintiff in the Enron suit filed by Campbell Harriso=n & Wright, had roughly 2,000 shares of Enron stock in her retirement accou=nt and has suffered losses of about $140,000 as a result of the stock s dec=line. The suit alleges that the trustees of the Enron 401(k) plan violated =their fiduciary duties by not informing plan participants that the company =stock was in peril.=20The suit filed by Hagens Berman, also alleges that the company failed to wa=rn participants about risks of remaining invested in Enron stock. In additi=on, it accuses Enron of systematically misrepresenting its financial result=s since 1998 in connection with the partnerships under investigation by the= SEC.=20Roy E. Rinard, a lineman for Enron in Oregon who is a named plaintiff in th=e suit filed by Hagens Berman, has seen the value of his retirement plan fa=ll to $70,000 from $470,000, largely as a result of the decline in Enron s =stock. ""I feel like I have been betrayed,"" Mr. Rinard said in press release= issued by his lawyers. ""I lost my savings, my plans for the future, everyt=hing.""=20Under federal pension law, companies are allowed to offer their own stock i=n retirement plans, and are allowed to force employees to hold onto the sto=ck. Enron doesn t let employees diversify out of shares they receive as mat=ching contributions to the 401(k) plan until age 50.=20However, plan trustees are supposed to operate the plan in the best interes=ts of the participants, which includes choosing prudent investments. Genera=lly, to prove that the plan s administrators breached their fiduciary dutie=s, employees must show that the trustees knew the stock was a bad investmen=t. This presents a high hurdle, so it is not surprising that prior lawsuits= over losses in company stock in 401(k) plans have generally come in the wa=ke of allegations of accounting irregularities.=20Lynn Sarko, one of Ms. Tittle s attorneys with Seattle s Keller Rohrback LL=P, is also co-lead counsel in a similar lawsuit against Lucent Technologies= Inc., Murray Hill, N.J. Another firm representing Ms. Tittle is Dalton Got=to Samson & Kilgard PLC, which is lead counsel in a similar suit against Ik=on Office Solutions Inc., Malvern, Pa. The two law firms are representing M=s. Tittle with Campbell Harrison & Wright.=20The suits against Lucent and Ikon, like the suit against Enron, allege that= then-current plan trustees kept offering company stock in the plan despite= knowing of serious business problems that would hurt the stock price. Repr=esentatives for Ikon and Lucent say their companies didn t require employee=s to invest in the company stock, and educated employees about the need for= diversification.=20The suit in which Mr. Rinard is plaintiff notes that on Oct. 17, a day afte=r Enron announced the company was taking a nonrecurring charge totaling $1.=01 billion in the third quarter, Enron ""locked down"" the 401(k) plan s asse=ts, preventing participants from selling Enron shares. (A ""lock-down"" occur=s when a retirement plan is transferred from one administrator to another, =and generally lasts several weeks, during which time participants can t mak=e changes in their investment choices).=20The lock-down was lifted on Nov. 19. In the interim, on Nov. 8, Enron annou=nced it would be forced to restate downward its reported financial results =from 1997 through 2000. By the time the lock-down was lifted, as a result o=f all the negative news the shares had fallen to below $9 a share from $32.=20 on Oct. 17, when the lockup started, Hagens Berman attorney Karl Barth s=aid.=20""They were locked into it right when Enron knew it was going to be announci=ng some really bad news,"" Mr. Barth said. ""Mr. Rinard s looking at having n=o retirement savings now. It s a horrible thing to have to start over in yo=ur 50s.""Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The Securities =and Exchange Commission filed civil fraud complaints against the Andersen p=artner who audited Sunbeam and against the firm itself in the Waste Managem=ent case.=20Now Enron has repudiated the financial statements that were certified by Ar=thur Andersen, in the process shaving more than half a billion dollars from= the company s reported profits in recent years.All of which raises the question: Has Arthur Andersen become the black shee=p of the accounting industry?=20It is not an easy question to answer, and not everyone is willing to rush t=o judgment.   If you want to attack Andersen for Enron, you need to know mo=re than we know,   Arthur Levitt, the former chairman of the Securities and= Exchange Commission, said this week.=20But if there is a thread connecting what is known about the three cases, it= is materiality. In all three cases, Andersen auditors spotted bad accounti=ng but were persuaded it was immaterial and therefore allowed it to go ahea=d.=20Materiality is one of those flexible concepts that can get accountants into= trouble. The idea is that it doesn t much matter if a few little things we=re gotten wrong. But they can add up.=20At Enron, however, they did not add up to that much -- a total of $93 milli=on over four years. The biggest restatement of Enron profits concerns a rel=ated party that Enron now says should have been consolidated. It is not cle=ar if Andersen had the facts needed to make that decision at the time.=20To those who treasure the role of auditors, the humiliation of Andersen is =painful. Back in the 1950 s, it was Leonard Spacek, Andersen s managing par=tner, who warned that   the profession s existence is in peril   because it= was not showing enough independence. His public prodding was crucial in ma=king the industry do a better job. Two decades ago, when the issue on the t=able was pension accounting, Andersen was the only major accounting firm to= break with clients and push for good rules.=20Now Andersen s backbone is open to question. It was evidence that senior pe=ople at Andersen repeatedly gave in to pressure from Waste Management that =led the S.E.C. to bring that suit, which the firm chose to settle without a=dmitting it had done anything wrong. The partner that the S.E.C. says looke=d the other way at Sunbeam is fighting the accusations, and Andersen says h=e acted properly.=20Lynn Turner, who was chief accountant of the S.E.C. at the time and is now =director of the Center for Quality Financial Reporting at Colorado State Un=iversity, says what is happening to Andersen now is reminiscent of what hap=pened to Coopers & Lybrand when he was a partner there and the firm had a s=eries of highly publicized blown audits.=20  We got bludgeoned to death in the press,   he said.   People did not even= want to see us at their doorsteps. It was brutal, but we deserved it. We h=ad gotten into this mentality in the firm of making business judgment calls=.   By that he meant that the firm paid too much attention to not offending= clients and not enough to good accounting.=20For Andersen to avoid that fate, its relatively new chief executive, Joseph= Berardino, who declined to be interviewed for this column, will need to se=t a tone inside the firm making clear that he expects auditors to show the =backbone that Mr. Spacek epitomized. And then he will have to convince the =public of that.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. =09Business/Financial Desk; Section CChase and J. P.

The Chase-J. P. Morgan combination helped advance the bank into the investm=ent banking elite, just as Mr. Harrison intended. But with Wall Street and =the economy in far different places today than they were when the deal was =put together, the many mergers, stock sales and other money-making opportun=ities that were supposed to justify the high-priced acquisition have largel=y dried up for now.=20Consequently, deal makers and analysts who follow the bank are already spec=ulating that Mr. Harrison, 58, may ultimately be compelled to do yet anothe=r large deal, this time to diversify his business away from its heavy empha=sis on Wall Street.=20J.

Morgan Chase has been scrambling to maintain the support of =other banks while simultaneously keeping the merger with Dynegy on track.==20Thanks largely to the slump on Wall Street, J. P. Morgan Chase s profits fe=ll by two-thirds in the third quarter, to $449 million from $1.4 billion in= the period a year ago. Its stock has dropped 15 percent this year, more th=an other banks  shares. The bank s stock is ahead of investment banks like =Goldman Sachs, with which J. P. Morgan Chase increasingly competes.=20  The jury is still out in many respects on this merger,   said Judah Kraus=haar, an analyst at Merrill Lynch. Nevertheless, he likes J. P. Morgan Chas=e s stock, he said, because   expectations are very low.  =20All J. P. Morgan Chase s competitors are suffering from the slowdown on Wal=l Street. But some, like Citigroup, are better diversified and have greater= involvement in old-fashioned consumer banking, which is proving to be a st=rong moneymaker this year.=20Nearly a third of J. P. Morgan Chase s revenues are consumer-oriented. By c=ontrast, its chief New York rival, Citigroup, gets half its revenues from c=onsumer businesses.=20  The timing of the merger was bad,   said Steven Wharton, a banking analys=t at Loomis, Sayles & Company, which owns about a million J. P. Morgan Chas=e shares.   There s no disputing that.  =20Actually, Mr. Harrison disputes it.   I can t tell you how happy I am about= having done this merger,   he said in a recent interview.   While there ar=e pluses and minuses to operating in a weak economic environment, we have a= much stronger platform to manage with during this difficult time.  =20In Mr. Harrison s favor is his battle-tested team of top executives who hav=e worked together for a decade or more. Few executives remain in the top sp=ots from the old J. P. Morgan. Instead, most major posts are filled by mana=gers who have worked with Mr. Harrison since his days at Chemical Bank, whe=re he spent most of his career. Mr. Harrison s team successfully gobbled up= Manufacturers Hanover Bank in 1991, then followed that with Chemical s mer=ger with Chase Manhattan in 1996 before incorporating Morgan into the fold =last year.=20The group of Chemical veterans includes Marc J. Shapiro, who oversees finan=ce and risk management at J. P. Morgan Chase; Donald H. Layton, one of two =leaders of investment banking; and James B. Lee Jr., the bank s senior deal= maker. The team also includes Dina Dublon, the bank s chief financial offi=cer.=20Two other senior executives have also lived through big deals. Geoffrey T. =Boisi, the other investment banking leader, was the one-time investment ban=king chief at Goldman, Sachs. David A. Coulter, in charge of Chase s retail= bank, had been chief executive of Bank of America before it was bought by =NationsBank.=20  There aren t many teams that have gone through as many mergers as Bill Ha=rrison and his team,   said Mark G. Solow, managing principal at GarMark Ad=visors, an investment firm, and a former senior executive at Chemical.=20Still, Ms. Dublon acknowledged that the tough economy was making the J. P. =Morgan takeover more difficult than the earlier combinations.=20  In general, mergers are very hard on morale,   she said.   There is no qu=estion that this one has a tougher emotional toll.  =20The bank s executives are making the best of a bad situation. They have tak=en advantage of the slowdown to cut around 8 percent of the combined banks = staff, or about 2,500 more employees than anticipated at the time the merg=er was announced.=20Many of these job cuts were aimed at high-cost investment bankers: J. P. Mo=rgan Chase expects that 6,000 jobs in its investment banking division will =have been eliminated by the end of the year.=20  We have focused on the tougher jobs to cut,   Ms. Dublon said.=20In some ways the overall market turmoil has made it easier for J. P. Morgan= Chase to overhaul its staff. With fewer jobs available on Wall Street, Mr.= Shapiro said, the employees who are left behind are less apt to complain a=bout changes in their jobs.   People have fewer options,   he said,   so yo=u have a little more control over the process.  =20Thanks partly to these cuts, the bank estimates the saving from cost cuttin=g will be $3.6 billion annually, compared with an original projection of $2= billion at the time of the merger.=20The cost cutting has helped compensate somewhat for a sharp drop in profits= in the bank s core businesses.   What we can control and are managing very= aggressively is the expenses of the company,   Ms. Dublon said in a confer=ence call with reporters on Oct. 17, the day earnings were announced.=20Aside from cost cuts, the weakness on Wall Street makes it hard for the ban=k s executives to point to tangible gains in investment banking, where fees= were down 24 percent in the third quarter. But Mr. Harrison points to mark=et-share gains the bank has achieved at the expense of competitors on Wall =Street. He hopes that when the investment banking business revives, J. P. M=organ Chase will hold on to these gains.=20The bank is particularly proud of its standing in two areas: mergers and ac=quisitions, and the underwriting of large investment-grade bond deals.=20The bank ranked 5th worldwide in the highly profitable category of advising= on mergers during the first nine months of 2001, up from Chase s 12th-plac=e finish and J. P. Morgan s 10th-place standing during the same period last= year, according to Thomson Financial Securities data.=20The merger and acquisitions business, which Chase had been slowly building =for years, is stronger following the merger with J. P. Morgan, said Mr. Lee=, a vice chairman at the bank. As a result, the bank is able to win assignm=ents providing advice to customers who dealt with the old Chase only for lo=ans.=20Mr. Lee remains proud of the bank s work with Enron, the energy company, de=spite its troubles. J. P. Morgan Chase, along with Citigroup, raised $1 bil=lion in bank financing for Enron earlier this month. It was also hired to a=dvise the company, which hopes to be saved from collapse by being taken ove=r by Dynegy.=20The old Chase, long a lending powerhouse, would have had a good shot at lea=ding the bank financing, but an advisory role would have been less certain.= Mr. Lee said the investment banker advising Enron came from the old J. P. =Morgan. But with merger activity slow, there are few such deals to go aroun=d.=20The bank is also proud of its strength in long-term investment-grade bonds,= another area that business executives say has been enhanced by the merger.= It moved up to second place in that area so far this year, compared with s=ixth place a year ago.=20The bank has taken advantage of a boom in large corporate bond offerings, a= surge driven by today s low interest rates. In May J. P. Morgan Chase rais=ed $12 billion in bonds for WorldCom, the telecommunications company, in th=e largest corporate debt deal in the United States on record.=20Unfortunately for J. P. Morgan Chase, the fees for underwriting investment-=grade debt are small compared with the money to be earned coordinating offe=rings of stock, where J. P. Morgan Chase remains a second-tier competitor.==20The bank actually lost market share in the rankings for underwriters of sto=ck, falling to 9th place this year, compared with the old J. P. Morgan s 6t=h-place finish a year ago. (Chase was 11th.)=20Mr. Harrison said the bank was taking advantage of the slowdown in stock of=ferings to build momentum slowly in that business.   We think we have a cha=nce in the second half of this year to be in the top five,   he said.=20Given the slowdown, some bankers predict that Mr. Harrison will ultimately =do another deal, either to expand his consumer banking business or to bolst=er weak areas in investment banking, like the equity division.=20  The general view is that the combination with J. P. Morgan didn t do enou=gh,   one investment banker said.=20Mr. Harrison disagrees:   I don t feel,   he said,   we need to do another =large deal to be successful.  Photo: William B. Harrison Jr., the chief executive, says he has no doubts =about the wisdom of forming J. P. Morgan Chase, even though the the economy= has slowed since then.   I can t tell you how happy I am about having done= this merger,   he said. (Associated Press) Chart:   Still Looking for the =Right Mix   When J. P.

That wa=s followed by renewed volatility in power prices, and this time the prices =were headed down, not up.=20And then came a crushing blow against trading firms - the unraveling of the= industry s largest player, Enron Corp. (ENE).=20Simply put, the perfect storm stalled, and a business once buoyed by high g=as prices, strong demand and tight supply now lies in tatters.=20The stocks of companies whom some say should be valued more like growth sto=cks than utilities are instead mired at around nine-times earnings - about =where traditional utilities trade.=20And the chance for recovery in 2002?=20Basu Mullick, portfolio manager of the Neuberger Berman Partners fund, is w=illing to bet there is. He thinks energy traders deserve at least the same =price-to-earnings multiple as the broader market s median, which is current=ly between 16- to 17-times future earnings, he said. It s just a matter of =time before the stocks get there.=20""They were just recovering from Gray Davis,"" Mullick said, referring to the= governor of California, who had accused ""out-of-state"" energy traders of a=rtificially inflating the price of power in the state, and triggering the s=tate s energy crisis. ""Now, they are recovering from Enron.""=20The fund manager also blames lower commodity prices, warm weather and poor =demand for the recent weak performance in the group.=20""Energy convergence companies are putting up terrific growth rates,"" he sai=d. ""I don t think they should get the same valuation as a garden-variety ut=ility.""=20Still, others think the stock market is continuing to make distinctions bet=ween the energy traders by taking a harder look at the companies  strategie=s and financial disclosures.=20Enron s precarious financial situation underscores the importance of accoun=ting issues. Although many of Enron s financial problems aren t solely the =fault of mark-to-market accounting issues, there has been growing attention= paid to this form of financial reporting because of the earnings volatilit=y it can create.=20Answers Elude Investors=20Investors are asking hard questions, and not always getting the answers the=y want.=20Using mark-to-market methods, a company calculates the fair market value of= a commodity position - whether it s a contract, an option, a swap, etc. - =at the time, even if the value of the position is realized over a longer pe=riod. The problem with this method is the actual cash a company realizes fr=om the position might not be the same value the company calculated in its o=riginal assessment. Also, sometimes it isn t easy to calculate the fair val=ue of the commodity position. This is particularly true in instances where =the market for the commodity isn t liquid.=20Over time, companies with the highest level of disclosure regarding their m=ark-to-market gains will most likely trade at higher multiples to counterpa=rts that provide little or no disclosure, said ABN AMRO Inc. analyst Paul P=atterson.=20Encouragingly, it appears companies may already be responding to the call f=or added disclosure. According to a survey Patterson conducted, more compan=ies with energy trading units were willing to disclose the details of their= mark-to-market accounting practices during third-quarter conference calls =compared with those in the second quarter.=20Patterson said he prefers earnings that are cash-based.=20""All things being equal, we believe reported earnings that more closely ref=lect the timely realization of cash have a higher quality associated with t=hem than earnings that do not,"" he said.=20He expects investors to become smarter and learn to distinguish between ear=nings growth through accrual accounting and growth fueled by mark-to-market= accounting.=20At the end of the day, it is not a matter of simply producing profits, but =being able to say where those earnings came from, said one investor, who ma=nages a pension fund.=20Some investors also may be placing a greater emphasis on the cash flow the =energy merchants produce.=20Tim O Brien, portfolio manager of the Gabelli Utilities Fund, said energy m=erchants that own the physical power assets to back up their trading positi=ons should trade at a premium to an independent power producers and traditi=onal utility companies.

The trade engine Kiodex was asked to build is ""subs=tantially complete, but the company can t speak to Nymex s overall electron=ic-trading strategy,"" a Kiodex source said.=20The eNymex platform was conceived as a forum for trading over-the-counter e=nergy products, but Nymex has already moved ahead with plans for trading so=me of them on Access, initially an overnight trading system that was expand=ed in September. It hopes, for example, to launch gas swaps based on delive=ry at the Henry Hub within the next six weeks on Access, Jacobovits said.==20""We ve expedited plans for a Henry Hub natural gas swap contract,"" Jacobovi=ts said. ""Traders could be looking for OTC clearing on a neutral-based plat=form, which is a factor in that decision.""=20Before Sept. 14, Access was used only to trade energy futures at night, aft=er the day s Nymex session had ended. Use was limited to Nymex members with= dedicated phone systems.=20The exchange had been planning to expand use of Access, but ended up doing =so sooner than it had expected. On Sept. 14, it started offering Access tra=ding over the Internet, a move that will eventually allow Nymex to open up =trade to more users.=20The move was intended to help keep futures markets liquid after the Sept. 1=1 attack on the World Trade Center. Nymex s building, located near where th=e trade towers stood, was shut down for several days after the attacks. Exp=anding its already existent Access system to the Internet helped ease poten=tial liquidity problems that could have arisen from shortened floor trading= hours after Nymex reopened.=20Development of the eNymex system began last year under the direction of for=mer Nymex Chairman Daniel Rappaport. In August, Nymex said it would launch =the eNymex platform within four to eight months. New Nymex President J. Rob=ert ""Bo"" Collins Jr. said then that vendor problems had slowed development =of the system s front-end technology and caused the delays. But he still ex=pected eNymex to launch without any meaningful changes to its original prod=uct line.=20If Nymex combines parts or all of the platform originally intended as eNyme=x with Access, the new system may end up being known as eNymex.=20""eNymex right now is looking for a new mission,"" said an industry source cl=ose to Nymex. ""You know how politics works. We don t scrap it, we just rena=me it. Anything we do electronically is now going to be called eNymex. But =the original deal and concept that Rappaport initiated is done.""=20Nymex s reconsideration comes as the energy-trading world undergoes rapid c=hange. The two most successful online energy trading platforms -- Enron Cor=p. s (ENE) EnronOnline, and IntercontinentalExchange, or ICE -- have seen t=heir luck turn - in opposite directions.=20Enron Corp. (ENE), which accounts for about 25% of the trade in U.S. power =and gas markets, faces questions about its creditworthiness as the Securiti=es and Exchange Commission investigates complicated financial dealings. Enr=on s possible merger with Dynegy Inc. (DYN), now appears to be in doubt, an=d energy trading companies are pulling back their exposure to the company.==20Enron executes about 60% of its power and gas trades on EnronOnline. When E=nron s troubles surfaced last month, Nymex quickly moved to extend its clea=ring services to over-the-counter natural gas derivatives, a move the tradi=ng community saw as an attempt to grab market share.=20ICE, on the other hand, is moving ahead with plans to capture more energy t=rade on its electronic format. ICE closed a deal this summer to acquire the= London-based International Petroleum Exchange - Nymex s chief competitor a=nd Europe s largest traditional energy exchange. It plans to move all IPE e=nergy contracts to its Internet-based system and offer clearing services fo=r some over-the-counter contracts.=20Nymex is exploring alliances that could give it a better footing in the new= competitive landscape. One idea under review is a joint venture with the C=hicago Mercantile Exchange to offer e-mini contracts for Nymex products on =CME s Globex electronic-trading system, the person close to Nymex said.=20Nymex officials wouldn t confirm whether they re talking with the CME, but =they said the relationship between the exchanges is a warm one.=20""Nymex is always open to strategic alliances,"" Jacobovits said. ""There s no=thing we ve agreed to at this point, but we have open dialogue with a numbe=r of exchanges concerning strategic alliances.

Houston, Dec. 3 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. is courtinginvestors to revive its crippled trading business, even as itloses customers who fear the company will be unable to make goodon its obligations.     Energy companies such as Mirant Corp. and Aquila Inc. havetaken business elsewhere. At EnronOnline, the Web site that oncehandled $2.8 billion in commodity transactions a day, trading hasplunged, raising doubts that Enron will be able to rescue thetrading business.     Enron, once the largest energy trader, sought protectionyesterday from creditors in a bankruptcy that was the largest inU.S. history. The company is in talks with financial institutionsto fund the wholesale trading business ``under new ownership,  Chief Operating Officer Greg Whalley said in a statement.     ``Until we ve seen the fallout from this bankruptcy, I don tthink you re going to find a lot of entities that are prepared totrade with   Enron, said Daniel Gordon, head of commoditiestrading at Hagerstown, Maryland-based Allegheny Energy Inc., whichowns utilities in five states. ``Anyone who thinks this will be aquick bankruptcy is deluding themselves.       Houston-based Enron has lost $26 billion in market valuesince mid-October, when the company restated $586 million inearnings and disclosed that its executives may have profited fromEnron s dealings with affiliated partnerships that bought Enronassets.     Enron, which was the buyer or seller on every transaction onits Web site, handles only a fraction of the trades it once did.The company said today it will fire 4,000 workers in Houston.                     `Difficult to Resurrect      The wholesale trading business of EnronOnline, which had beena valuable property, ``has for all practical purposes ceasedoperation and in a post-bankruptcy scenario, may in fact bedifficult to resurrect,   Fitch Inc., a Chicago-based firm thatrates corporate credit, said in a report today.     Trading has surged in markets that compete with Enron,including the New York Mercantile Exchange and IntercontinentalExchange Inc. Dynegy Inc. Chief Executive Officer Chuck Watsonsaid his company s energy-trading Web site has seen increasedtraffic.     ``EnronOnline will just disappear,   said Peter Fusaro,president of Global Change Associates Inc., a consulting firm inNew York. Enron s portfolio of trades ``is evaporating   and ``isreplaceable   with competing electronic trading platforms.     Dynegy s Watson said on a conference call with analysts andinvestors that his company would try to expand in Europe, whereEnron was the dominant energy trader. Enron said Friday it wouldfire more than 1,000 workers in Europe.                           Shutdown     EnronOnline shut down Wednesday after Dynegy canceled itsplans to buy Enron, depriving Enron of the cash it needed to meetits obligations and all but ensuring the company would be forcedto seek protection from its creditors.     Later in the week, the site was offering trading in 472commodity products, a third of its usual offerings, according tocompany officials. On Thursday, the site logged 825 trades, downfrom the normal amount of about 5,000.     ``We re actively trading,   Enron spokesman Eric Thode saidtoday, declining to elaborate.     ``There may still be trading going on, but it s primarily tounwind positions,   Fitch credit analyst Ralph Pellecchia said.``It s certainly not new growth or for profitability. For allintents and purposes, Enron s horsepower, its earnings-generatingmachine, has been effectively shut down.                             Needs Capital     Enron declined to name the ``leading financial institutions  it is in talks with to provide new capital for the tradingbusiness.     ``If these discussions are successful, they could result inthe creation of a new trading entity with a strong andunencumbered balance sheet,   Whalley said. ``We understand thatit may take time for counterparties to resume normal tradinglevels with this entity, but we are confident that this businesscan be put back on a solid footing.       Enron s top creditors include Citigroup Inc. s Citibank andJ.P. Morgan Chase & Co. The Blackstone Group is helping Enron withits financial restructuring.     A revival of Enron s trading business isn t likely anytimesoon, analysts said.     It may take ``months to years, if ever,   said David Chang,manager of natural gas trading at Bank of America NA. In themeantime, Enron has ``alienated a lot of its suppliers andcustomers,   he said. ``It would be difficult for   Enron to comeback.                         Stopped Shipping     NiSource Inc., which operates 16,000 miles of gas pipelines,stopped shipping Enron s gas on Saturday because of creditconcerns, company spokesman Kelly Merritt said. Williams Cos.,which controls 27,000 miles of pipes, stopped shipping Enron s gaslast week.     ``Enron has lost all credibility,   Fusaro said.     In the meantime, some traders that had become accustomed tothe ease and speed of online transactions are finding it difficultto adjust.     Kevin Cokinos, co-owner and vice president at Cokinos EnergyCorp. in Houston, said he has had to rely on his old network oftelephone brokers for price quotes rather than Enron s Web site.     ``It s hard to do as many deals because you re spending somuch more time on each one,   said Cokinos, whose company tradesabout 500 million cubic feet of gas a day. ``We hope somebodypicks up EnronOnline so it will come back the way it operatedbefore.

Richard Ryan, chief executive of an Oak Brook, Illinois,company called Standard Power & Light Inc., announced an offer topurchase at least a majority of Enron s common stock for less than$1 a share. Standard Power expects to file disclosure documentsrequired for the bid by the end of next week, Ryan said.     ``From a funding standpoint, everybody is asking me the samequestion: `Show me the money!    Ryan said in an interview. ``Ourgoal is to complete the assembly of a management team, make surethe cash is there to do the deal, and then we are going to startmaking the filings.       Buying Enron is a less daunting feat than it would have beenbefore Enron s financial collapse, because its stock market valuehas plummeted to $298 million from about $67 billion in August2000. Still, Ryan, who lacks an established name in the energybusiness, must convince Wall Street that his bid is legitimate.     News of the pending offer caught the interest of investorsand traders, seven of whom called or e-mailed Bloomberg News formore information on Ryan and Standard Power. Enron shares rose 14cents, or 54 percent, to 40 cents today.                         Unusual Offer     Karen Denne, an Enron spokeswoman, said, to her knowledge,Enron has yet to receive a formal offer from Standard Power.     The takeover bid is unusual because Enron, based in Houston,filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcycode on Sunday. When companies reorganize through a Chapter 11filing, creditors and bondholders must be repaid beforestockholders. The result is often that creditors get new shares inthe company and existing stockholders are wiped out.     Enron s bankruptcy proceeding is expected to be complexbecause it has many off-balance-sheet liabilities and contingentobligations. As a result, financial analysts are unsure of theextent of Enron s liabilities.     Ryan said he thinks Enron s total debt is $45 billion to $50billion. Enron and 13 of its units listed assets of $49.8 billionand debts of $31.2 billion in yesterday s bankruptcy filing.                         Return to Stockholders     ``If you sell off the non-energy related business assets andcompanies, I think there is a good chance the company can retireall this debt and make a minimal return to equity holders over a20- to 25-year term,   Ryan said.     Ryan estimated that this return would equal 10 to 12 percentfor current stockholders on an after-tax basis. He said he ismaking a number of assumptions in this estimate.     Standard Power was incorporated about six years ago todevelop power plants and acquire generating assets, Ryan said. InJune, the company sold its assets to a sister company calledStandard Energy Ventures, and Ryan retired.     Ryan said he has been following Enron since its inception andformerly worked in gas marketing with a number of people who werelater employed at Enron, the seventh-largest U.S. company in termsof revenue last year.     Standard Power is now signing contracts with third parties tomanage Enron s pipeline and generating assets, Ryan said. Thiswould alleviate some of the company s overhead so that incomingcash can be used to repay debt, he said.     A worry for Ryan is that Enron has fired 1,100 people in theU.K. and said today it will cut 4,000 jobs at its Houstonheadquarters. Enron s workforce will be a critical factor inreviving the company s business and repaying creditors, he said.     ``If they don t have any assets, we can t pay (the creditors)back,   Ryan said.--Miles Weiss in Washington (202) 624-1879 Enron to Cut 4,000 Jobs at Headquarters in Houston (Update6)2001-12-03 17:00 (New York)Enron to Cut 4,000 Jobs at Headquarters in Houston (Update6)     (Adds comment from Texas governor in sixth paragraph.)     Houston, Dec. 3 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. will cut 4,000jobs at its Houston headquarters, more than half of its staffthere, as part of the energy trader s plan to survive the biggestbankruptcy in U.S. history.     Enron told most of its Houston workers to go home and waitfor notification of whether they were fired, spokeswoman KarenDenne said. Employees needed to keep the energy trading operationsrunning are still on the job, she said.     ``Trading operations will continue, and pipeline operationswill continue,   Denne said. She said she didn t know which jobswould be cut.     Enron has said it will try to emerge from bankruptcy as anenergy trading company backed by unnamed financial institutions.It will provide details in U.S. bankruptcy court in New York thisafternoon on how it plans to cut back its investments in otherbusinesses, such as managing energy consumption for corporationsand wastewater treatment.     The company fired about 1,100 workers in the U.K. on Friday.Enron had about 21,000 employees as of the end of September, two-thirds in the U.S., about fifth in the U.K. and the rest in otherparts of the world.     Enron employed about 7,500 people in Houston. Governor RickPerry said he directed the Texas Workforce Commission to send``rapid response teams   to the city to help fired workers getservices and assistance, said Gene Acuna, a spokesman for theRepublican governor.     Shares of Enron rose 14 cents to 39 cents. The stock tradedas high as $90.75 last year.                           Rapid Demise     The company, once the fastest-growing company in the energybusiness, began to unravel in October as it wrote off more than $1billion of failed investments in water companies, broadbandtrading and retail electricity sales, and disclosed a $1.2 billionloss in shareholder equity because of its dealings with affiliatedpartnerships.     Investors grew concerned that Enron was using thepartnerships to hide debt and losses. The U.S. Securities andExchange Commission is investigating, and Enron restated earningsfor almost five years last month, wiping out $586 million inprofits.     Enron and at least 13 units declared bankruptcy yesterday,listing total assets of $49.8 billion and debts of $31.2 billion.It filed after Dynegy Inc., also based in Houston, backed away onWednesday from a plan to buy Enron for about $23 billion inassumed debt and stock. Enron declared bankruptcy after failing toget financing needed to keep its daily operations running and itsdebt rating was lowered to junk, forcing it to pay off $3.9billion in debt early.     Workers streamed out of Enron s sleek glass office tower indowntown Houston at late morning today, carrying boxes of personalpossessions and saying goodbye to each other. Police officers onhorseback helped direct traffic on nearby streets.     Employees said they were separated at the office this morninginto two groups. One was told to leave and check Enron voice-mailfor updates on their status. Members of the other were told theywill be kept and were ordered to stay on the job, employees said.                       Integrity Questioned     ``The worst thing was the ones they are going to keep werewhisked away into a room like they were having champagne andcaviar, and we were getting booted,   said Chris Ihrig, who workedin Enron s industrial markets group, which traded steel and forestproducts. ``They always preached respect, integrity,communications and excellence, and it never was upheld.       Enron Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay saidyesterday that he will try to keep workers who are key to runningtrading operations, which used to provide 97 percent of Enron srevenue before it began to slide toward bankruptcy in October. Thecompany had more than $100 billion in revenue last year.      Ihrig said about 75 percent of the industrial markets groupwas told to go home. He said the dismissed workers don t know whattheir severance pay will be. Their vacation time will beforfeited, he said.     Enron workers who receive their pay by check as opposed todirect deposit were asked to not cash those checks until tomorrow,he said. ``Obviously, there is a cash problem,   Ihrig said.     Some workers blamed upper managers for the company sdownfall, saying they didn t tell investors or employees what thecompany s problems were until too late.      ``It s simple,   said Wesley Wilder, also of the industrialmarkets group. ``The people at the top weren t as honest as theysaid they were.  --Margot Habiby, Jim Kennett and Russell Hubbard in HoustonDynegy Sues Enron in Texas for Natural-Gas Pipeline (Update1)2001-12-03 17:02 (New York)Dynegy Sues Enron in Texas for Natural-Gas Pipeline (Update1)     (Updates with closing share prices in last paragraph.)     Houston, Dec. 3 (Bloomberg) -- Dynegy Inc., answering alawsuit filed as part of Enron Corp. s Chapter 11 bankruptcyfiling yesterday, sued in a Texas court to gain control of Enron sNorthern Natural Gas Co. pipeline.     Enron sued in federal court seeking $10 billion in damagesand asking the court to prevent Dynegy from taking over thepipeline.     The dispute came after Dynegy canceled its $23 billion buyoutagreement with Enron on Wednesday. Dynegy had invested $1.5billion in Enron to help keep it running until the merger could becompleted. To back its investment, Dynegy got all the preferredstock in the Northern Natural line.     Enron s suit accuses Dynegy of using the takeover bid to getthe pipeline and remove, rather than rescue, a competitor. Dynegysays Enron didn t disclose all the debt it was obligated to payand that it clearly has the right back out of the merger and takeover the line or get its $1.5 billion back with interest.     Dynegy s suit in Harris County District Court in Houstonseeks a temporary injunction to force Enron to transfer the 16,500-mile pipeline to Dynegy, citing a provision in the buyout thatallowed Dynegy ``automatic possession   of the pipeline if theacquisition fell through.

Enron stock, whichtraded as high as $90 in August 2000, is all but worthless afterthe company wrote off more than $1 billion of investments anddisclosed a $1.2 billion loss in shareholder equity because of itsdealings with affiliated partnerships.     ``They caused us to lose our money, and they made money,  said Steve Lacey, an emergency dispatcher for Portland GeneralElectric, Enron s Oregon-based electric utility unit.     Lay didn t return telephones calls seeking comment andSkilling, through a spokesman, declined to comment.     Lacey, like many of Portland General s 2,700 employees,bought Enron shares for his 401k investment plan. The stock, whichhe planned on using for his retirement, closed today at 40 cents.Lacey filed suit against Enron in Houston on Nov. 20, claiming thecompany prohibited employees from moving shares out of theinvestment plan as the stock fell in October.                           Billions Owed     In its bankruptcy filing, Houston-based Enron and 13 of itsunits listed assets of $49.8 billion and debts of $31.2 billion.It owes billions to creditors such as Citigroup Inc., Bank of NewYork Co., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Duke Energy Corp. and WilliamsCos.     The insider selling at Enron is high for an energy company.Insiders at ExxonMobil Corp., the biggest publicly traded oilcompany, sold $410 million of stock during the same period,according to Washington Service, which compiles records from theU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.     Those sales pale in comparison with some computer-relatedtechnology companies. Microsoft Corp. insiders, among the mostactive sellers at any U.S. company, sold 367.2 million sharesworth $31.4 billion since 1990, records show.     In the past year, Microsoft insiders sold 3.6 million sharesfor $222 million.                          Biggest Seller     In all, 60 officers, directors and trusts they control soldEnron stock during the past decade.     Lou Pai, former chairman of Enron s NewPower Holdings Inc.,made the most from selling Enron shares during the past decade.Pai sold 3.89 million shares for $270.3 million. Most of Pai ssales were made last year at prices ranging from $50.52 to $78.17a share. Pai couldn t be reached immediately for comment.     Ken Harrison, former chairman and CEO of Portland General,sold almost 992,000 shares for $78 million. Enron bought theutility in 1997 for $3.1 billion in stock and debt. Harrison alsocouldn t be reached immediately for comment.     ``It would seem that insiders had some advance warning thatthere were better opportunities,   said David Coleman, editor ofVickers Weekly Insider Report.     The selling among Enron insiders outweighed the buying duringthe past decade. In all, insiders bought almost 488,000 shares,paying a total of $20.7 million. The last executive to buy Enron sstock: former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, who bought10,000 shares on Aug. 16 at $36.98, according to the WashingtonService.     Fastow was ousted in late October after the SEC began aninvestigation into Enron s accounting and its use of investmentpartnerships. Enron restated earnings for almost five years inOctober, wiping out $586 million in profits, as it accounted forlosses from the partnerships.     Fastow couldn t be reached for comment.--Loren Steffy in Dallas (214) 954-9453 or steffy@Bloomberg.netU.S. Banks  Enron Debt Is Overstated, Analysts Say (Update1)2001-12-03 16:54 (New York)U.S. Banks  Enron Debt Is Overstated, Analysts Say (Update1)     (Updates with closing stock prices.)     New York, Dec. 3 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. says it owesCitigroup Inc., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Bank of New York Co.$7.55 billion in the largest bankruptcy case in U.S. history.Analysts say the amount owed the banks may be less than half that.     Here s where they differ.     Enron yesterday said in court papers it owed thousands ofcreditors $31.2 billion in loans, unpaid bills and other debts.Citigroup, the biggest creditor, is owed $3 billion stemming froma loan it arranged last year, Enron said.     Still, the banks probably hold only a fraction of the debtsEnron says they re owed. That s because banks routinely sell partsof loans to other lenders as a way to disperse risk. Banks alsoare listed as the holders of bonds and other securities that infact are owned by investors. The banks are listed as the creditorsin Enron s papers.     ``It s very difficult to piece together the reality,   saidRobert Napoli, an analyst at ABN Amro Inc. who owns Citigroupshares. ``They ve syndicated out a portion of the loan and theycould have hedged the credit risk through derivatives.       Citigroup, the largest U.S. financial services company, isprobably owed $1 billion at most, analysts say, and much of thatis backed by collateral such as gas pipelines, on which it shouldbe able to collect.     The company s profit may be lowered by between $250 millionand $500 million before taxes, or between 3 cents and 5 cents ashare after taxes, as a result of its involvement with Enron, saidNapoli, who recommends investors buy Citigroup shares. Citigroupearned $2.08 a share in the first nine months of the year.                         Hurting Earnings     J.P. Morgan Chase -- which Enron says is owed $2.1 billion --says its exposure totals about $900 million -- $500 millionunsecured, and $400 million backed by collateral.     That exposure could result in a 15-cent decline in earningsper share, said Goldman, Sachs & Co. analyst Richard Strauss. Thesecond-largest U.S. bank earned $1.54 a share so far this year.     J.P. Morgan Chase acts as a representative for holders ofEnron bonds, so while the company is listed by Enron as a creditoron $1.9 billion of bonds, it may not be owed a cent on that debt.     Enron s $2.45 billion debt to Bank of New York may work inmuch the same way, said Lehman Brothers analyst Henry Dickson. Heestimated the bank is owed about $50 million.     Much of J.P. Morgan s exposure is tied to Citigroup s $3billion loan to Enron, a credit Enron doesn t even mention. Asyndicate of at least five other banks -- including J.P. MorganChase -- contributed to that loan, according to Bloomberg data. Aslead arranger, Citigroup likely holds about 10 percent of theloan, meaning its exposure is about $300 million. J.P. MorganChase s share of that is likely less.     Bank of America Corp., Commerzbank AG and Barclays Bank Plcare among other Enron lenders not listed as creditors.     Still, concern that the banks  losses may exceed forecastshelped send their shares and bonds lower today.     Citigroup shares fell 99 cents to $46.91 in trading on theNew York Stock Exchange. Citigroup s 7.25 percent notes due in2010 fell to 107 28/32 from 108 21/32, pushing the yield up 21basis points to 6.18 percent from 5.97 percent.     J.P. Morgan s stock lost $1.17 to $36.55. Its 7.9 percentcoupon notes due in 2010 fell $16 per $1,000 face amount to 1113/32, pushing the yield up 23 basis points to 6.18 percent from5.95 percent on Friday.     Bank of New York s 7.3 percent notes maturing in 2009 fellabout $20 per $1,000 face value to 108 3/32 from 110 7/32, traderssaid. Yield on the debt rose 32 basis points to 6.01 percent from5.69 percent. Its shares dropped $1.04 to $38.20.     ``They re big numbers, but these are big institutions,   saidGreg Habeeb, a bond money manager at Calvert Group, which doesn town the banks  securities. ``I wouldn t be going running outbuying the bonds now, but I don t think (Enron losses are) bigenough to worry about.  --Michael Nol, Terence Flanagan and George Stein in the New YorkEnron Corp.

Pension Plans Estimating Millions Lost On Enron InvestBy Christiane BirdOf DOW JONES NEWSWIRES12/03/2001Dow Jones News Service(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Pension plans are estimating millions of dollars in losses on their investments in Enron Corp. (ENE). The once-mighty energy company filed for bankruptcy protection Sunday, following a dizzying decline in stock value, to 26 cents Friday from a 52-week high of $84.88 on Dec. 28.As among the largest investors in Enron, pension plans are also among those hardest hit by the Houston giant s fall. The $112 billion New York State Common Retirement Fund estimates its Enron losses to be about $58 million, said spokesman Jeff Gordon. Up until last week, the fund held about 2.1 million Enron shares in an internally managed index fund and about 2.5 million in externally managed active funds. However, ""we sold almost all our 4.6 million shares on the day Enron was removed from the index - we re pretty much liquidated now,"" Gordon said. The $143 billion California Public Employees  Retirement System, or Calpers, is expecting a net loss of $45 million on its 3 million Enron shares. ""That s based on an estimated average share price - we ve been buying Enron at different prices for years,"" spokesman Brad Pacheco said. The plan also still has a $156 million interest in a joint investment with Enron called Joint Energy Development Investments II (JEDI II). ""We re still evaluating that venture. The board will discuss its future at its next meeting,"" said Pacheco, noting that JEDI II, which invests in third-party energy companies, has given the retirement system a 74 percent return-on-investment since its inception in 1978. The $54 billion Ohio Public Employees Retirement System, which held 1.6 million Enron shares on Sept. 1, estimates its losses to be about $68.8 million, according to spokeswoman Linda Lewis. The plan acquired its Enron shares at an average price of about $43 each, and owns it through funds indexed to the Russell 3000. Similarly, the $7.6 billion State Retirement System of Illinois expects to lose about $15 million on its Enron investments, said Robert Knox, assistant director. The fund will lose about $5 million in Enron shares and about $10 million in Enron bonds, he said. Other pension plans are currently in the process of determining their losses - a detailed process that could take weeks, due to the complexities of their systems, plan representatives said. The $96 billion Florida Retirement System, which owns 9.7 million Enron shares in both indexed and actively managed funds, is ""making calculations right now - it s a difficult actuarial matter because we bought stocks at different times,"" said spokeswoman Lee Baldwin. She estimated that the plan would be reporting its loss in about a week. The $85 billion New York City pension funds will also ""take weeks to calculate losses, it s very complicated to figure out...We ve owned some Enron stocks for years, probably since the company existed,"" said spokesman David Neustadt. The five New York City pension funds hold a total of about 2.9 million Enron shares, mostly in portfolios indexed to the Russell 3000. A spokeswoman for the $103 billion California State Teachers Retirement System, or Calstrs, said that the plan ""won t comment on losses."" Calstrs owns about 2 million Enron shares, of which 88% are in indexed funds and 12 percent in enhanced index funds. -Christiane Bird, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-2046; christiane.bird@dowjones.comCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Funds Liquidate Enron Bond Holdings, See Little RecourseBy John ShipmanOf DOW JONES NEWSWIRES12/03/2001Dow Jones News Service(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- It looks as though mutual funds that had sizable positions in Enron Corp. s (ENE) bonds rushed for the exits in the same fashion as those who owned the company s stock. Gary Schaefer, who manages the Monetta Intermediate Bond Fund, said he finished liquidating his Enron stake last week.Schaefer said the position had amounted to about 2% of the fund s $35 million in net assets. ""It was significant,"" he said. ""It was not a good day by a long stretch."" ""It s amazing that the kinds of things that took place (at Enron) were not more transparent,"" he said. Schaefer said he didn t expect his firm to seek any legal recourse regarding its losses on its Enron stake, in part because of the complexity and size of the financial morass. ""This thing is years (away) from getting resolved,"" he added. The Huntington Short-Intermediate Fixed Income Securities Fund also unloaded its Enron bond holdings, said Chief Investment Officer Randy Bateman. He wouldn t say exactly when the bonds were sold, except that it was before Enron s bonds were cut to junk status. Bateman said the firm sold its holdings ""based on internal credit analysis."" He also said he did not expect his firm to seek any recourse on its investment. According to fund tracker Morningstar Inc., the Huntington fund also had about 2% of its net assets in Enron bonds. A spokeswoman for Strong Capital Management said the firm still owned a small amount of Enron bonds, but declined to comment further because the firm is in the process of trading in the position, she said. -By John Shipman, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5171; john.shipman@dowjones.comCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

(EOT) said its general partner wasn t among the companies included in Enron Corp. s (ENE) voluntary petition for bankruptcy. As reported, Houston energy trader Enron filed for protection from its creditors in the biggest bankruptcy filing in U.S. history after its debt was downgraded to junk status and Dynegy Inc. (DYN) backed out of a deal to acquire the company.In a press release Monday, EOTT added that its subsidiary partnerships haven t filed for bankruptcy either. EOTT s general partner, EOTT Energy Corp., is a wholly owned subsidiary of Enron, and EOTT Energy Partners  doesn t have officers or directors of its own. Instead, the company s officers and directors are those of the general partner. In addition, EOTT s current working capital facility was obtained with Enron. On Friday, EOTT said it had signed an interim credit facility with its primary lender, Standard Chartered, to replace its existing facility with Enron. EOTT s New York Stock Exchange-listed shares recently traded at $12.30, up $3.30, or 36.7%, on composite volume of 2.25 millions shares, well above average daily volume of 119,810 shares.

US Energy Markets Unmoved By Enron Chapter 11 FilingBy Kristen McNamara and Jon KampOf DOW JONES NEWSWIRES12/03/2001Dow Jones Energy Service(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- U.S. energy markets were largely unmoved Monday by Enron Corp. s (ENE) filing for Chapter 11 over the weekend. Energy companies generally maintained their suspensions on trading with Enron and were casting a sharper eye on Dynegy Inc. (DYN), which is being sued by Enron for wrongfully terminating its offer to acquire the one-time market leader.No company was known to have altered its business with Dynegy, and many traders showed little concern about Enron s suit, but companies did say they were monitoring the situation. Major energy trader Aquila Corp. (ILA) was trading normally with Dynegy but monitoring the situation. ""That situation could change depending on how people evaluate it,"" spokesman Al Butkus said. ""It s a very fluid situation."" FirstEnergy Corp. (FE) said it was also monitoring Dynegy s compliance with its credit requirements. ""This is a situation that we re following closely,"" spokesman Ralph DiNicola said. Companies continued to do business normally with Dynegy, an energy broker said. Prices for North American power and gas weren t moved by Enron s filing, which was widely expected. Factors such as weather and longer-term supply fundamentals continued to dominate the power and gas markets. January gas futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange closed down 7.1 cents Monday at $2.640 per million British thermal units. Power prices in the U.S. Northeast were also weaker with mild weather forecasts, adequate generation and weak clearing prices. Power prices were also lower in the west.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 	Dueling Enron, Dynegy Lawsuits Start Of Long BattleBy Janet WhitmanOf DOW JONES NEWSWIRES12/03/2001Dow Jones News Service(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Dueling lawsuits filed by former merger partners Enron Corp. (ENE) and Dynegy Inc. (DYN) are only the beginning of what is sure to a long legal battle, merger and acquisition lawyers predict. At this stage, it s far from certain who would win, they add. ""Remember the 100 years war that we all studied in history?,"" asks George M. Knapp, a partner at law firm Squire Sanders & Dempsey LLP. ""This will make that look brief.""Concurrent with its bankruptcy filing on Sunday, Enron filed a lawsuit against Dynegy, charging its former suitor had no grounds to terminate their $9 billion merger and actually contributed to Enron s collapse. The suit, which was filed in New York in the same court as the bankruptcy petition, also contends that Dynegy has no right to acquire Enron s valuable pipeline company, Northern Natural Gas Co. of Omaha, Neb. In a counter suit filed Monday in Harris County, Texas, Dynegy seeks immediate control of the Northern National pipeline company. Under the terms of the cross-town rivals  original merger agreement, Dynegy received an option to buy the coveted property - even if the merger fell apart - after it injected $1.5 billion into Enron. Now, however, that s a matter for the courts to decide. ""This is a kind of lawyers  paradise,"" said Tom Burnett, president of Merger Insight, an affiliate of Wall Street Access. ""The risk to Dynegy is that that contract won t hold up to buy the Northern Natural Gas assets. A bankruptcy judge may decide to hold an auction."" In that event, Dynegy would be left with an equity stake in Enron. Sensing that the companies are in for long legal battle and that Dynegy may not wind up with the pipeline assets, some investors unloaded their Dynegy shares, sending the stock price sliding more than 8% Monday to a low of $26.26.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Stocks Slide on Worries about Middle East, Enron; Dow Industrials Down 1% in Late-Afternoon TradingBy Peter Edmonston12/03/2001Dow Jones Business News(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)The Wall Street Journal Online Stocks retreated Monday as conflict in the Middle East and a bankruptcy filing by energy giant Enron outweighed better-than-expected economic data.In late-afternoon trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 101 points, or 1%, to 9751 after trading nearly 150 points lower earlier in the day. The Dow industrials fell 22.14 points Friday. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index lost 22 points, or 1.1%, to 1908.60 after closing 2.68 points lower in the previous session. Other major indexes also declined Monday. The Standard & Poor s 500-stock index dropped 9.60 to 1129.90, the Russell 2000 Index fell 2.80 to 458, and the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index shed four to 575.20. Bonds turned higher in choppy trading. The dollar strengthened against the yen and the euro. Concerns over the fallout from the weekend s suicide bombings in Israel damped any beneficial effects from economic reports that exceeded Wall Street s expectations. ""The events in Israel have created a lot of uncertainty,"" said Peter Coolidge, senior equity trader at Brean Murray & Co. ""That more than counteracts any positive news on the economic front."" At least 25 people were killed over the weekend in attacks by Palestinian suicide bombers in Jerusalem and the northern Israeli port city of Haifa. On Monday, Israel fired nine missiles near Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat s headquarters in Gaza City in an apparent retaliation. The violence overseas detracted from some fairly upbeat readings on the U.S. economy, including a report from the Commerce Department that consumer spending rose by a record 2.9% in October. Robust spending on cars and other big-ticket items contributed to the reading s largest jump since 1959, when the data series began. The previous record had been a 2.6% increase in September 1987. Personal income was virtually unchanged for the second month in a row, roughly in line with economists  forecasts. The Commerce Department also surprised economists by reporting a 1.9% increase in total construction spending for October. Forecasts had that figure falling by 0.5%. September construction spending was revised to show a 0.7% drop from the 0.4% decline previously reported. Meanwhile, a closely watched index of manufacturing activity rose more than expected in November. The National Association of Purchasing Management reported Monday that its purchasing managers index rose to 44.5 last month from 39.8 in October. Economists have been forecasting the PMI would rise to 42. A PMI reading of 42.7 is considered the threshold between expansion and contraction in the wider economy. So November s PMI of 44.5 suggests that the economy is growing, albeit slowly. Last week, the National Bureau of Economic Research formally declared that the country had entered a recession back in March, ending the longest period of economic expansion in U.S. history. The government reported that total economic activity fell at an annual rate of 1.1% in the July-September quarter. Against this backdrop, analysts called the latest NAPM data encouraging. ""After absorbing last month s aftershock of the terrorist attacks, the manufacturing sector showed surprising resilience in November,"" Norbert Ore, director of the survey, said in a statement. ""The trend is definitely in the right direction, but it is too soon to claim an imminent recovery. Based on this report, the sector regained a significant portion of the output lost in October,"" Mr. Ore said. Matthew Freedman, an economist at Economy.com, said the NAPM report ""shows that the deterioration in manufacturing appears to be slowing quite dramatically."" But the stronger-than-expected numbers did little to comfort investors, who have been scrutinizing economic readings in recent weeks for signs that the business cycle has hit bottom. The markets are especially interested to see if rising levels of unemployment will put a dent in consumer spending, which is considered a key to keeping the current economic recession a mild one. Most major international markets traded lower Monday, but the U.S. economic data helped narrow the losses late in the day in Europe. Frankfurt s Xetra DAX closed essentially flat and London s Financial Times Stock Exchange 100-share finished 0.8% lower. In Asia, Tokyo s Nikkei 225 Stock Average closed with a loss of 3.1%, and Hong Kong s Hang Seng Index dropped 1.1%. Meanwhile, the turmoil surrounding energy-trading giant Enron continued over the weekend, as the company filed for bankruptcy protection on Sunday. The Houston firm simultaneously sued its would-be merger partner Dynegy for ""not less than $10 billion,"" accusing it of wrongful termination of their merger pact. News of the impending collapse of Enron had weighed heavily on the market last week. Some market participants suggested Enron s bankruptcy filing -- the largest in U.S. history -- continued to pull stocks lower on Monday. But others said it was largely expected and was having little effect on share prices. ""It could hurt the markets somewhere down the road, but I haven t heard a lot of people talking about it [Monday],"" said Mr. Coolidge of Brean Murray. Enron shares rose 11 cents to 37 cents. Dynegy was down nearly 8%. Financial-services stocks took a hit Monday, dragged lower by some negative comments from analysts and fears about exposure to the Enron debacle. Shares of brokerage firm Morgan Stanley sank 6% after Goldman Sachs analyst Richard Strauss pulled it from his recommended list and cut his rating on the stock to ""market perform"" from ""market outperform."" Mr. Strauss said that the 60% surge in Morgan Stanley s shares since Sept. 20 has made it expensive compared to its peers. Citigroup, a component of the Dow Jones industrials, declined nearly 2.7% and J.P. Morgan fell 3.8%. The two companies advised on the failed merger between Enron and Dynegy and now find themselves among Enron s largest unsecured creditors. Automotive stocks were also trading lower Monday as the big auto makers offered up monthly sales results for November. Shares of Ford Motor were down 6.1% on news that it is expected to warn this week that quarterly results will miss forecasts. Separately, the company reported a 4.4% increase in total U.S. vehicle sales, helped by 0% financing offers. Ford rival General Motors, which has also been offering generous financing plans to lure buyers, reported a 13.3% jump in car and truck sales from a year ago. Shares of GM fell 1.4%. In major U.S. market action: Stocks fell. On the Big Board, where 923.7 million shares traded, 1,804 stocks fell and 1,291 rose. On the Nasdaq, 1.17 billion shares changed hands. Bonds rose. The 10-year Treasury note rose more than 1/4 point, or $2.50 for each $1,000 invested. The yield, which moves inversely to price, fell to 4.71%. The 30-year bond added more than 3/8 point to yield 5.26%. The dollar strengthened. It bought 123.93 yen and traded at 89.14 cents to the euro, compared with 123.44 yen and 89.65 cents late Friday in New York. Copyright (c) 2001 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

FERC Chair Sees Enron Fall Fostering Market TransparencyBy Mark GoldenOf DOW JONES NEWSWIRES12/03/2001Dow Jones Energy Service(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The collapse of Enron Corp. (ENE), although a human tragedy, could give a major boost to transparency in energy markets and the energy industry, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Chairman Patrick Wood III said Monday. ""The market doesn t like clouded players and has a relentless way of moving them to the sidelines,"" Wood said in a speech at an energy investors conference in New York.Unanswered questions about how the one-time market leader was making its money, and how much it was making, contributed to the unraveling of confidence in the company that brought about its swift collapse. Enron s Chapter 11 filing Sunday is ""emphatically not"" an impediment to the development of transparent, competitive power markets, Wood said. The chairman said he hadn t planned to discuss Enron s situation, but departed from his planned remarks due to the high level of interest following the company s filing for bankruptcy-court protection. Enron s employees will likely find work at a ""new breed of energy companies"" with more open cultures that, Wood hoped, would be the only kind of energy companies around in five years. Wood characterized Enron s collapse as ""a hiccup - or, more graphically, a belch - heard  round the world."" Separately, the nation s top energy regulator said price controls will remain a feature of the country wholesale electricity markets for the foreseeable future. By this spring, Wood expects FERC to lay out rules for dividing control over the country s high-voltage transmission lines - across which wholesale power is moved - among a handful of independent operators. Those rules will include measures to adjust prices when markets get out of control, Wood said. The details haven t been hammered out yet, but the controls would likely resemble those in effect in the Mid-Atlantic electricity market run by PJM Interconnection LLC, Wood said. Specifically, the $1,000 price cap in place in PJM will likely be needed in other markets until consumers are able to quickly reduce their usage when prices spike, he said. The chairman clearly wasn t satisfied with the current cost-based price controls in place in the western U.S. power markets. ""I never want to rely again on such a blunt tool,"" Wood said. ""In California, we did what we had to do."" Such caps discourage investments in power plants used only when demand peaks, Wood agreed. Price limits make it difficult for those plants to recover their costs, he said. FERC won t be looking at retail electricity competition any time soon, Wood said. ""My mandate at this time is standardization of wholesale markets,"" he said. ""When you put down the rules and tell people how they re going to get their money back, the money comes in, and not at such a high-risk premium for the financing."" Wood expects heavy investment in merchant transmission, just as there has been heavy investment in merchant generation over the past few years. FERC expects soon to write a standard national contract for hooking up new power plants to the country s transmission system. -By Mark Golden, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-4604; mark.golden@dowjones.comCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

IN THE MONEY: Enron s Bankruptcy Filing Was A Rush JobBy Michael Rapoport12/03/2001Dow Jones News Service(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)A Dow Jones Newswires Column NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Apparently Enron Corp. (ENE) still hasn t quite gotten the hang of this little concept of full disclosure - even now that it s paid a heavy price for not providing it.The day after Enron filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, an assortment of peculiarities and unanswered questions still surrounds the company - from information missing from the company s bankruptcy filing to the question of why Enron filed over the weekend in a court far from its home. Let s give the fallen energy giant the benefit of the doubt and assume that the lingering questions and missing pieces stem from an enormous rush to file for Chapter 11 as quickly as possible, rather than from any more-nefarious motive. Certainly the past several weeks, in which Enron collapsed as ever-worse information dribbled slowly out of the company, have given investors reason enough to be suspicious of what Enron says. But whatever the reason behind it, the effect of all this uncertainty is the same: It means that nagging questions about just how well Enron can get a handle on its own chaotic situation, and whether it can continue as a viable business in the wake of its problems, just won t go away. Let s start with Sunday s filing, which notes that Enron has $13.15 billion in debt - but acknowledges that that amount ""does not reflect off-balance-sheet and contingent obligations."" Hmmm. Wasn t the revelation that Enron had moved so much of its debt off its balance sheet - to entities controlled by its own executives, yet - a big part of what got it in trouble to begin with? Seems the level of that debt is certainly something anyone concerned about an Enron bankruptcy would want to know, but it seems Enron either can t or won t provide it. Either way, it s not an encouraging sign. There are other holes in Enron s filings. The list of the creditors holding Enron s five largest secured claims, for instance, consists of Citibank, Chase Manhattan Bank and three entries that all read like this: ""Not available at this time. To be provided at a later date."" Location of the substantial assets held by the Enron subsidiaries that filed for bankruptcy along with the parent company? ""Information regarding the location of the other debtors  substantial assets is not available at this time and will be provided at a later date,"" Enron said. Enron s estimated weekly payroll and cash disbursements and receipts for the next several weeks, matters that are now under the bankruptcy court s jurisdiction? Not available. The situation is so convoluted and hurried that even some of the information Enron HAS filed appears to be a little fluid. As Christina Cheddar of Dow Jones Newswires has reported, CMS Energy Corp. (CMS), which Enron lists as one of the creditors of its marketing and trading unit, says it actually owes Enron money when all its trading positions are netted out. Two more curious factors, both of which speak to the haste in which Enron filed its bankruptcy petition: the fact that it filed on a Sunday - which even in hurly-burly New York, where the filing was made, is mostly a day for rest, football and the Sunday paper - and filed before it had nailed down the debtor-in-possession financing it needs to keep operating. What was so urgent about Enron s need to file that it couldn t wait for Monday morning, or till it had financing in place? An Enron spokesman declined to comment. Was it because Enron felt it had to file quickly to throw a monkey wrench into efforts by its savior-turned-nemesis Dynegy Inc. (DYN) to take over Enron s Northern Natural Gas Co. unit? Was it to stabilize a situation in which Dynegy claims Enron has been having trouble delivering natural gas to its customers to meet its obligations? At this point, no one besides Enron and its lawyers really knows. All this ambiguity only lends credence to the idea that even Enron is having trouble getting its arms around the tangled financial structure that made the company nearly impossible for even Wall Street s savviest minds to understand. And the missing information about the off-balance-sheet debts and the creditors  claims, in particular, suggests that Enron s search for unencumbered assets to back its new financing may be more difficult and chaotic than the company had hoped. In a weird way, the very chaos of the process may actually speak well of Enron s honesty: If Enron was trying to mislead anyone and had a real reason to believe its rescue deal with Dynegy might fall apart, wouldn t it have had a bankruptcy filing at the ready, with all i s dotted and t s crossed, instead of going through this? Maybe. Right now, though, all indications are that this bankruptcy filing is a serious rush job, with some significant information uncertain or missing. And that s not a situation that any investor or potential investor in Enron should be happy about. -By Michael Rapoport, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5976; michael.rapoport@dowjones.comCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

USA: Enron says about 4,000 workers to be laid off.12/03/2001Reuters English News Service(C) Reuters Limited 2001.HOUSTON, Dec 3 (Reuters) - Shattered energy trader Enron Corp. will lay off about 4,000 employees as part of a cost-cutting move in the wake of its bankruptcy filing, a spokesman said on Monday. ""We re planning about 4,000 job cuts, most from Houston,"" spokesman Mark Palmer said. Some 7,500 people are employed in the company s Houston head office.Enron capped a dramatic fall from the heights of the energy world on Sunday, filing the biggest bankruptcy case in U.S. history. The assets involved total $49.8 billion, easily dwarfing the $35.9 billion held by Texaco at the time of its 1987 bankruptcy. Sources said Enron s massive computer network was being shut off, floor by floor, and leaders of business units informed their employees that they were to go home for the day and await notice of their future with the company.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

USA: U.S. House energy panel sets meetings on Enron.12/03/2001Reuters English News Service(C) Reuters Limited 2001.WASHINGTON, Dec 3 (Reuters) - A U.S. congressional panel said on Monday it had scheduled meetings with representatives of the Securities Exchange Commission, auditing firm Arthur Andersen and Enron Corp. to explore the energy giant s rapid disintegration. Rep. Billy Tauzin, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, has directed his staff to meet with the SEC, Enron financial auditor Arthur Andersen and top Enron executives, a panel spokesman told Reuters.""The committee will be moving aggressively to pin down what went wrong and what, if anything, Congress can do to prevent this type of thing from happening again,"" a spokesman for the Louisiana Republican said. Committee staff will meet with SEC s head of enforcement and general counsel on Tuesday and with top representatives from Arthur Andersen on Wednesday, the spokesman said. On Thursday, three House energy committee staffers will travel to Houston to meet with top Enron officials ""to begin laying the groundwork for a hearing,"" the staffer said.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

USA: Enron bankruptcy judge heard more high-profile cases.12/03/2001Reuters English News Service(C) Reuters Limited 2001.NEW YORK, Dec 3 (Reuters) - Judge Arthur Gonzalez, who will hear the bankruptcy protection case of Enron Corp. , is a veteran of several high-profile cases, including this year s Chapter 11 filing by appliance maker Sunbeam Corp. ""They re lucky to have him,"" said one lawyer who has represented a company that appeared before Gonzalez in U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York.The lawyer, who requested anonymity, said Gonzalez was viewed as ""a very fair judge. ""He is extremely deliberate, very hard-working and very thorough,"" he told Reuters. ""I don t think there was a single hearing at which he had not read all the pleadings. Other judges are more laissez faire and some don t read all the pleadings, preferring to just ask questions,"" the lawyer said. ""Judge Gonzalez makes careful decisions."" Asked if that meant Gonzalez was inclined to favor a company petitioning for bankruptcy protection, he said: ""Well, there are certain judges you would prefer not to have."" Gonzalez, who was appointed to the federal bankruptcy court in New York in 1995, has recently been hearing the case of Sunbeam, which filed for Chapter 11 protection this year after questions about its accounting. In May, federal securities regulators accused former top executives at the appliance maker - including former Chief Executive Albert ""Chainsaw Al"" Dunlap - of financial fraud that cost investors billions of dollars. Last week, Gonzalez postponed a hearing on Sunbeam s second amended plan of reorganization - which was to be heard on Tuesday - to next March 19. Coincidentally in both cases, in which the company s accounting is central, the accounting firm Arthur Andersen was auditor for Sunbeam and also Enron. Gonzalez also oversaw the 1998 bankruptcy filing of Livent Inc., the Canadian theater-production company that collapsed amid major accounting irregularities. Last year, Gonzalez was on the bench for the case of Iridium LLC, a satellite telephone service, which entered the history books as one of the costliest corporate fiascoes of all time. The Washington-based company cut off telephone service to its 55,000 customers as a prelude to court-ordered liquidation. Iridium s last act was to ""de-orbit"" or ultimately burn up its constellation of 66 satellites. The network has been reported to have cost $5 billion to $7 billion. Gonzalez cleared Iridium to spend $8.3 million to start winding up its business while selling remaining Earth-bound assets, including ground stations. Last year, he was also in charge of the case involving U.S. Media Holdings Inc. and its Golden Turtle Press Inc. unit which filed Chapter 11 petitions. This year, Gonzalez has been hearing the Chapter 11 case of insurance company Reliance Group Holdings Inc. and also Australia s collapsed HIH Insurance Ltd. Gonzalez received a degree in accounting from New York s Fordham University in 1969 and a master s degree in education from Brooklyn College in 1974. He got his law degree at Fordham University s law school in 1982 and LLM in taxation in 1990 from New York University Law School. After a spell in private practice, he was appointed Assistant U.S. Trustee in the Southern District of New York in 1991 and U.S. Trustee for the Second Circuit in 1993.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

USA: US Northwest Natural seeks to buy Portland General.By Chris Baltimore12/03/2001Reuters English News Service(C) Reuters Limited 2001.WASHINGTON, Dec 3 (Reuters) - Northwest Natural Gas Co said Monday it asked approval from federal energy regulators to buy Portland General Electric Co. from Enron Corp for $1.8 billion. Northwest expects to soon file a similar request with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, a company spokesman said.The purchase is unrelated to the status of Enron s Northern Natural Gas Pipeline, to which Dynegy Inc. is claiming rights after canceling a bid to purchase Enron last week. Portland, Ore.-based Northwest Natural Gas is a local natural gas distribution company that serves about 530,000 customers in Oregon and Washington. It is Oregon s largest natural gas utility, while Portland General is the state s biggest electric utility. Northwest filed for approval with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) on Friday, after a similar application with the Oregon Public Utilities Commission on Nov. 28, with a response requested by May 15, 2002. The Oregon commission s ""watershed approval"" would allow Northwest to take operational control of Portland General by the end of 2002, said Northwest spokesman Jim Boehlke. Northwest said it wants FERC to act on its request by Feb. 20, 2002. Enron s declaration of bankruptcy over the weekend ""could complicate things"" for Northwest s plans for Portland General, Boehlke said. But Northwest is ""going forward (with the purchase) without regard for what it going on in the Enron bankruptcy proceedings,"" he said. A bankruptcy court is likely to look favorably on Northwest s purchase, Boehlke said, because it will give Enron cash to pay debts. ""We re about to give (Enron) $1.55 billion dollars in cash. Hopefully a bankruptcy court would want that to go forward,"" he said. The deal also includes $50 million in common stock and $200 million in special preferred s"

I plan to start doing this tommorrow morning, assuming we get the Connecticut fax and phone numbers tonight.Detailed changes:	- Fax number will be in Connecticut, and will roll to here.	- Connecticut call center person will answer any Help Desk calls, which will then be transferred here.	- Connecticut call center will send PA faxes in accordance with instructions from here.	- Cover letter will have UBS letterhead, but will be unsigned and will specify Connecticut numbers	- Splash page will be modified to show Connecticut numbers	- Once we reach Closing Date, the numbers will be permanently forwarded to here.	- All future correspondence (and the bulk mailings) will specify the Houston numberThe concern is that during the waiting period, we need for UBS people to represent UBS interests on all official correspondence with customers.Please call me if you have any concerns. I plan to put out the revised Splash page and start the Top 50 marketing efforts at about 10:00 am tomorrow morning.Dave"

If you have any comments, please email me by 8:00 am CST.Thanks,DaveWe are continuing work to ensure our new online trading system, UBSWenergy, is ready for launch on the week of Feb. 11, which is the week following the anticipated Enron/UBS Closing Date of Friday, Feb. 8.To assist in this process, we are planning an online trading simulation for Thursday, February 7 from  0900 to 1100 (CST). It is planned to include all  traders, originators, mid/back-office staff and IT teams who would normally be involved with electronic trading.Purpose of the simulation - The simulation will test our ""live"" trading environment (restricted to internal access only) and will:Test the integrity and functionality of the system and related processes (including credit, risk, legal, operations, etc.)Provide an opportunity for traders to verify their products and product setupDemonstrate how the trading system and processes work to UBS staff visiting next weekNature of the simulation - The simulation will include testing of all processes related to trading and mid/back-office functions:Credit, Legal, Risk, Operations, and other groups:Profile tests for ""external"" customers (role-played by Originators)Profile tests for internal users (traders, back-office, etc.)Data and Process checking as completed transactions flow through Mid/back-Office systemsTraders and Originators:Traders will be managing their individual books and associated products. Although we may be restricted to certain financial products on launch day, both physical and financial will be available during the simulation. Each trader will be asked to manage their individual position and profitability goals for the simulation.Originators and others will be asked to play the roles of counterparties. Credit limits, etc. will be tested during the simulation.Information Technology:Will assist in preparing data on the system for the simulation.After the simulation is over, will work with the relevant groups to test the trade-data in various systems and risk booksWill ensure all simulation data is removed from the system after the simulation is complete.Next steps Traders and Originators will be contacted prior to simulation day to ensure they have appropriate access to the system.Originators will be assigned specific roles. You should expect to receive an email and/or handout on or before Wednesday, Feb. 6.UBSWenergy personnel will be meeting with back office personnel over the next several days to ensure everything is in place for the simulation.SummaryThis simulation is an important step towards re-launching our trading business. We appreciate the participation of everyone involved as we prepare for the public launch of UBS Warburg Energy and the UBSWenergy trading platform.If you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or ideas regarding this simulation, please feel free to contact Bob Shults (30397) or myself (31861).

The guarantee issue is already in play with the Canadian pipelines, power pools, office landlords, etc. and will be an impediment to closing and/or commencing business operations;2.  It is not that counterparties will be unlikely to transact with this new UBSW Canadian entity without credit support ... they will not;3.  Although parental g ee of UBS AG as credit support will help, the structure of a non-creditworthy sub supported by a parental g ee (with its own terms, conditions and limits) is the old Enron structure, and it may well not be well received in the industry.Peter.

The status is as follows:Texas Brine has been informed that another counterparty has presented a premium bid of $ 3 MM and has the opportunity to counter.  Texas Brine was the first counterparty to try to acquire the land at $2.35 MM.Reliant has slowed the transaction close due to their legal changes to the ""Act of Sale"" document.  As such, Gerald Nemec (my legal) is reviewing the document in conjuction with our Louisiana counsel as well as other relevant internal legal groups (i.e. litigation and environmental).I am confident that the land will get sold and was hoping to close the transaction prior to my leaving.  However, this bidding ""war"" has the potential for ENA to extract an even higher auction price.

This list is not all inclusive and we may need to discuss additional items as we continue with due diligence.  Please let  me know when we could meet to discuss them further.  Kevin and I had tentatively scheduled a November 28, 2001 meeting to discuss development of Purchase and Sale Agreements and possibly some of the items listed below:    Assuming that the MEGS system includes the riser and topside equipment    on Marathon s SP89 platform, we will need verify potential liability for    the same and any agreements addressing such access.  We would also like    to review the production handling agreement between Burlington/Mariner    and Marathon to verify the impact it may have on the future operation of    the system    We will need a definitive representation from Enron as to the status of    the producers committment obligations as of December 1, 2001 as defined    in the gathering agreements, including any credits due from prior years    excess flows.  It is our understanding that for the month of December    there will be a $93,000 credit to the payment due Gatherer and there are    no credits due in 2002.    In the Gathering Agreement ""Project Payout"" is referenced from the    Producer s JOA.  Please provide verification that this payout has    occured, the ownership percentage is now 51% Mariner and 49% Burlington    and that there is no future change that could affect the MEGS agreements    Need to review sample invoices, sample gas and condensate measurement    statements and demonstration of timely payment of such invoices by    producers    Have there been any leaks incurred and/or reported on the system?  Are    there any outstanding environmental issues on this system?    It is assumed that Enron/MEGS will be responsible to obtain any    assignments/consents that may be required to complete the transaction.    Please verify that this will be done.    The agreement stipulates that the insurance required is to include    business interruption coverage.  Please provide the coverage    declarations of the existing policy in effect for the system as a    reference for DEFS    Please provide a contact person who can discuss the environmental status    of the system with a DEFS EHS representative    Who is the MMS right of way owner and who is the MMS operator of record.    Please verify that the appropriate party has provided the MMS with a    ""Certificate of Financial Responsibility""    We may want to schedule a site visit to SP89.  Please provide the    contacts to make these arrangements    We would like to review any additional pipeline engineering data and    material specifications available, inspection and hydrostatic test    reports, as-built drawings, environental reports/permits, rights of    way/permit documents and other related engineering and construction    information I will continue to provide you with additional questions that arise.

297844,2001-11-26 06:10:48,"Louise, On Monday, prior to my leaving for Buffalo,  I spoke with Dave Gorte and was informed that since the sale of the Napoleonville Land was greater than $2.5 MM, it is categorized as a diversiture requiring a DASH.   Since the negotiations were quite contentious between Reliant, Texas Brine and Enron - we (Eva, Lisa and myself) had worked with Mr. Gorte to create multiple versions of the DASH.  It was not until Wednesday afternoon that Reliant was the chosen ""victor.""  In addition, since I felt you were apprised of the deal and Mr. Gorte had not informed me of an appropriate process, Lisa had waited until we knew who the counterparty was before getting on your schedule. Unfortunately, this meant Wednesday afternoon around 4 pm, but we had been informed by Tammi Schoppe that you were available until 5 pm. Even though the banks were closed, I had wanted to sign the executables on Wednesday so Reliant would not have an opportunity to change their mind over the holiday weekend.  It was certainly not our intent to have you not appropriately briefed regarding the transaction. I will be flying back to Houston today and will be landing around 5 pm.  Both Eva Rainer and Lisa Druzbik are in today and I am leaving instructions to (hopefully) close the deal today.  Julie Gomez will be signing on my behalf -- for detailed questions regarding the negotiations please refer to Eva.  My cell is 713-302-4187. Regards, Jean"

Savita discussed the presentation and the plan with John Arnold and he is supportive of the rollout and the new look and functionality.

This isn t expensive, most of the work is done anyway, but it is a new look and the quotes screen will now be expanded. I think it would be positive to do.

Outside of these risk related reports, Bob and his team have not provided reports or other documents to any of the potential suitors.  A few others on Bob Hall s team have had meetings with various due diligence teams and have discussed processes and controls, but again have not provided documents.  (I do, however, believe that in the case of at least one due diligence team that our monthly operations report was given to the due diligence team by someone outside Bob Hall s team.  I have not been able to confirm who within Enron provided that information.) I personally have not been involved in the majority of the due diligence process that has been conducted to date.  I had one brief meeting with Solomon Smith Barney, but did not provide them with any documents.  I have had two meetings with various team members with JPMorgan Chase, and again have not given them documents.  Even though the only documents provided to date by the operations team have been risk related reports, we are compiling other information that supports discussions that the operations team has had with due diligence teams.  The compilation of that data should be completed today.

What I agreed to with Greg is that I will be focused on the Estate and that I would be interested in talking about Netco in 30 to 60 days.  In the meantime, I will participate as much as you would like for me to on the due diligence process around the auction.  I will gladly meet with any and all prospective buyers to make them comfortable with our processes, systems, staff expertise and operational controls.

This pushes the cost of content for NewCo to over $360,000 for relatively little benefit.Therefore, contrary to what we agreed earlier, I would like to drop all of the content on the right side of the quotes screen.

299496,2001-12-31 10:53:29,"Louise,- It has come to my attention that some groups (back office) have been told that each individual within their group can elect to be part of the Estate or of NewCo. This is surprising to me. No such election has been offered to anyone in EnronOnline (nor do I think it would make sense to offer that), but before I tell people they do not have a choice, I wanted to check with you.  - ?- On the issue of bonuses: The numbers we put together made sense to me in the context of an annual  bonus with some element of retention mixed in. According to the auctions documents I looked at, retention is identified as being for a 1 year period, with 1/2 of the amount paid up front and 1/2 one year later. If this is the case, it significantly changes the complexion (i.e. more like a retention payment with an element of bonus, rather than bonus with an element of retention) and we should revisit the numbers.Dave"

Someone s notes from the call.Listened in on the analyst call this morning.  Here are my notes.  Did not yet have a chance to organize them, so they re simply in chronological order.The call began with Watson, Bergstrom, and Whalley reading from prepared statements.  Watson spoke for c. 10 minutes, Bergstrom for 5, and Whalley spoke for perhaps 30 seconds.  Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call.  Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them.  Specific points:EES will be a part of the new company.  Enron assets will be revalued at closing.  The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred.  If the merger does not go through, Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for  very little  additional consideration.  If DYN terminates the merger and ENE  has sufficient liquidity , ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred.  Debt/equity of combined company expected to be <45%.Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative.  ChevronTexaco will hold 169MM shares out of a total 650MM shares of the post-merger entity.  Watson reiterates that going forward, the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure, with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage.  In what was termed a ""new approach"", the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings.  Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true.  Dynegy owed Enron <$50MM.  Lay says that Enron had other options,  particularly financial .All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks.Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be  pretty big , but that the companies feel they re able to appropriately value this exposure.Lay says we have nothing else to hide, but internal investigation still under way.  Lay:  had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps $30MM more of risk capital, there would have been no question that they would have qualified for off-balance-sheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs.Dynegy says that  several  internal investigations continue at Enron, and thus DYN/ENE cannot say with certainty that there s absolutely nothing else out there.Doty (Dynegy CFO) says that late last week, ENE had  close to a billion  in cash.  Osprey will be unwound late next summer. Marlin will be unwound after closing.Many of the off-balance-sheet structures, including the credit-linked notes, are expected to be unwound/redeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing.With regard to ENE asset dispositions, these will be accelerated to the extent possible.  However, Doty says that  our backs are not against the wall , and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash.ENE will renew its 364-day facility (believe this is the $3Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago) within the next 6-8 weeks.  BBB-flat most likely rating for combined entity, according to initial comments from ratings agencies.McMahon says  no comment  to WSJ article indicating that ENE s banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks.Consolidation of trading activity: Mid- and back-office consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing, such that only the front office / trading books will need to be combined at closing.  EES, NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity, so there won t be much integration work required there.  The big integration effort will be ENA.Watson says that the  creative financing  surrounded non-core assets.  Doty adds that,  frankly , DYN assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model (uh-oh).  They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assets/businesses and left it at that.Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by  Enron s top three executives , who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies.  Says that their approach evidenced a  willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegy s deliberations on proceeding with the merger.Watson/Doty said that they re NOT 100% sure that no surprises remain in Enron s books--but that the risk/reward offered by the combination was compelling. The deal does have material-adverse-change outs for Dynegy, covering any MAC regarding Enron s assets or businesses.  Dynegy s lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a  blunt instrument  under which it would be difficult to bring a case, so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enron s total legal liability (from any source or cause of action) tops $3.5Bn prior to closing.McMahon adds that there  could  be more restatements, but he  does not expect  there to be more restatements.ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list.The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron.Enron is planning to hold an Enron-specific conference call in the next few days, tentatively scheduled for Wednesday.Initial reaction of ratings agencies  very positive  to combined entities.  McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end, had the merger not materialized.Dynegy s earnings guidance places Enron-related earnings accretion at $0.90-0.95, which represents a  25% haircut  to Enron internal estimates.  Doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies.Doty says that both Enron and Dynegy s books, as far as he understands, are relatively short-term in weight, and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity.  Says a  very very substantial  portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash.ChevronTexaco s investment in Dynegy was calculated at a 5% discount to public prices on the date of negotiation (not disclosed).  Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week, ChevronTexaco s investment is now at a  more substantial  discount to market prices.  ChevronTexaco has provision to get  different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better .  (No further clarification given).Whalley believes that  we ll retain  the Enron traders and marketers. They re used to being part of a winning team, and the combined entity will definitely be a winner.  They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders, and they are  very excited  by the combination.  They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained.  Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions.  He says that  to the extent necessary, yes. Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENE--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus, but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the Dynegy of today.Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture, he s a strong team player.  He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well.Give me a call if you d like me to try to clarify any of these comments.Patrick Tuckerx3-3055"

299777,2001-11-16 10:31:04,"Louise,I understand there is concern that the value associated with the assignment of the Lincoln Electric Sales Agreement to OPPD is not sufficient to justify paying $1.3 million to OPPD in order for them to assume this contract. There are some considerations on this contract which I think are important and which may not have been mentioned to you:- The original sales contract to Lincoln was entered into several years ago and is one of the contracts sometimes referred to internally as ""toxic waste"".- About a month ago, we agreed verbally with OPPD to accept assignment of the sales contract, as OPPD is one of the few parties which can serve it.- The execution of the documents has been delayed by Lincoln, who were initially refusing to consent to the assignment- We have another, larger under-water transaction with OPPD which we would like to move off the books at some point. We d like to keep OPPD happy to improve the chances that we can negotiate their buyout of our other sales contract to them)- If we fail to deliver, we will be subject to penalties in the amount of $45,0000 per MW on top of Liquidated Damages (Lincoln is 15 MW for 02 and 30 MW for 03).- This is a highly constrained area (only 6 counterparties can physically deliver in this area and OPPD is the only one which has the surplus power in order to serve Lincoln): the chance that we will be unable to deliver is high.- There is intangible value associated with not being in a situation where Enron fails to deliver.- Even if we do wind up serving the contract, the highly constrained nature of the area means we will likely be forced to pay extortionate prices for the power we do acquire.- Trading wishes to be out of this contract for aforementioned reasons and the fact that it will be very labour intensive to serve (day-ahead notice on 20% monthly load factor)Obviously, if the above is not sufficient justification to put the money out the door now, then we will smooth things as much as possible with OPPD - but I wanted to make sure you had all the info. before we kill the deal.

I know you are up to your eyes in credit issues, so we can talk about this when you get a chance.We wanted to review the impact of the merger on Bridgeline.  Specifically, the potential benefits for putting in place an asset management structure for BHLP.   Dynegy has expressed interest in commercially managing these assets and Enron would to, if we would not have to pay an excessive fee to do so.   Jean s initial analysis indicates that Bridgeline is currently undervaluing the accrual value of the pipe and over-valuing trading.  We may be able to use this fact to our advantage in establishing a ""low"" asset management fee to pay to Bridgeline.In addition, we may be able to reduce our deployed capital by selling the accrual value in BHLP to an MLP who is willing to pay a premium for stable cash/earnings.  The MLP could be one of Enron s (e.g. Northern Boarder, EOTT), or a Chev/Tex MLP (?), or even a 3rd party MLP.  The deciding factor should be the value the MLP is willing to pay for the earnings stream.We have continued to discuss this with the Chev/Tex board members who remain interested in evaluating the benefits of this structure.  In their view, the Dynegy/Enron merger is a positive fact because it removes the Dynegy vs. Enron competition.When you get a chance we can talk.Brian"

Sent: Monday, November 26, 2001 10:47 AMTo: Martin, John  D.Subject: FYI: ""Oh, the Games Enron Played"" (from the  Knowledge@Wharton website)...Oh, the Games Enron Played In the 1990s, Houston s Enron Corp. was Wall Street s darling. It had  thrown out the energy-industry playbook, remaking itself from a staid gas  pipeline company to a high-tech trading firm that created exotic securities for  betting on everything from gas prices to the number of hot days in  summer.Share prices soared from $30 to $90 between 1998 and 2000, as  sales increased from $31 billion to more than $100 billion. Enron executives  gained reputations as the energy industry s visionaries.This fall it all  came apart. Share prices have fallen by 90% this year, including a plunge from  just below $40 to less than $10 this fall. In October, Enron reported a  third-quarter loss of $618 million. The company s massive debt was downgraded to  near junk-bond status, and the CEO and CFO were expelled. Shareholders sued and  the Securities and Exchange Commission launched an  investigation.Finally, the humiliated company, which employs more than  20,000, agreed Nov. 9 to be taken over by smaller cross-town rival Dynegy Inc.  for about $9 billion in stock and $13 billion in assumed debt. It is not certain  the merger will take place since it is subject to regulatory approval and could  be blocked on antitrust grounds. And some news accounts suggest that major  Dynegy shareholders could derail the merger over concerns about inheriting  liabilities from current or future lawsuits by Enron shareholders.The  Enron story is not simply a case of a lone company that played with fire and got  burned. Enron was able to take enormous risks while keeping shareholders in the  dark because it could exploit accounting loopholes for subsidiaries that are  available to most publicly traded companies. Companies like Enron can legally  conceal massive debts because rules require a full accounting of a subsidiary s  balance sheet only when the parent company owns more than half of it.""If  I m a shareholder of Enron and I want full and fair disclosure, I would want  information about the entities Enron controls,"" says Wharton accounting  professor Robert E. Verrecchia. Yet Enron shareholders have never received such  a report.Enron s fate is crucial to the energy industry and other  markets it serves, points out Paul R. Kleindorfer, a professor of public policy  and an expert on deregulation at Wharton. Producers and users of gas, oil,  electricity and other forms of energy rely on Enron s system for trading  futures, forwards, options, swaps and other contracts to get the best prices and  control costs far into the future. Without such a system, deregulation simply  cannot work.""If Enron s trading platform were to go down it would not be  a minor loss,"" Kleindorfer says. ""It would be a huge loss for the industry?.In  the early 1990s the company single-handedly produced the backbone infrastructure  that has led to a whole industry of broker intermediation.""To some  extent, Enron appears to have been a victim of sagging securities prices and  volatile energy costs in 2000 and 2001, and it has lost hundreds of millions by  laying fiber-optic cable for which there is no demand. But although those  factors may have determined the timing of the company s troubles, they were not  the chief cause. Enron appears to have lost enormous amounts of shareholder  money by gambling at its own roulette wheels.""In hindsight, we made some  very bad investments in non-core businesses that performed worse than we ever  could have conceived,"" Chairman Kenneth Lay told analysts last week.How  did Enron get into this mess?Becoming a Market MakerWhen  it was created in 1985 by the merger of Houston Natural Gas and InterNorth,  parent company of Northern Natural Gas, Enron s chief business was the operation  of thousands of miles of natural gas pipeline. Lay became chairman in Feb. 1986.  Then early in the 1990s, the federal government took key steps to deregulate the  energy industry.Previously, large regulated utilities were vertically  integrated, giving them control from wellhead to consumer, Kleindorfer says.  Deregulation effectively broke apart the production, long-range transmission and  local distribution functions, leaving each to a different set of players. A  factory owner, for example, can now buy gas or electricity from number of  producers.To function, a free market such as this needs brokers, or  intermediaries, to create, buy and sell contracts for production and delivery,  and it requires a market maker to facilitate trading, just as the big Wall  Street firms and exchanges facilitate trading in stocks. Enron created that  marketplace. ""This intermediation activity, or brokerage activity, just  revolutionized the marketplace,"" Kleindorfer says.Since utilities and  other energy users must line up dependable supplies for many months in the  future, they rely on various forms of contracts specifying quantities, prices  and delivery dates. But before the commodity is delivered, prevailing prices may  go up or down, and a supplier may find it has promised to sell at a price that s  now too low, while a purchaser may find that it could have bought for less than  it had agreed to pay.Suppliers and purchasers therefore use a variety of  derivative contracts to benefit from prices that move in their favor and hedge  in case prices move against them. A company that has contracted to buy a  shipload of liquefied natural gas at a specific price in three months, could,  for a much smaller sum, buy an options contract giving it the right, but not the  obligation, to buy a shipload at a lower price. And it could buy an option  giving it the right to sell at a higher price. Thus it is protected regardless  of whether prices move up or down.This was the business Enron invented.  By permitting competition and price discovery far into the future, it brought to  the marketplace the most efficient pricing and allowed energy users to predict  and stabilize costs far into the future, Kleindorfer says. ""Having that  information historically, as well as projected into the future, could  revolutionize how you plan your business,"" he said. At the heart of  Enron s business strategy was the belief that it could be a big energy player  without owning all the power plants, ships, pipelines and other facilities  involved. Instead, it could use contracts to control the facilities in which  other companies had invested, says Ehud Ronn, director of the Center for Energy  Finance Education and Research at the Red McCombs School of Business at the  University of Texas at Austin. The Center trains masters candidates in the use  of energy securities. (Enron is one of the center s eight corporate  sponsors.)Enron, he says, evolved into something akin to a Wall Street  firm. ""Enron thought of itself in very similar terms as an investment banker  that wanted to tie up as little capital as possible.""By 2001, Enron had  evolved into a market maker for some 1,800 different products, many of them  energy- or Internet-related contracts or derivatives the company had created  itself. They included products allowing customers to buy, sell, hedge or  speculate in markets ranging from traditional commodities like coal, oil, gas  and electricity to cutting edge markets for Internet bandwidth, pollution  emissions, semiconductors, wind energy and many others. Prices for many of these  products were available on the company s free website, giving the energy markets  unprecedented price transparency.Betting on the WeatherTo  see how these products could be used, consider one of Enron s ""weather risk  management"" products meant for utilities, energy distributors, agricultural  companies and financial institutions. A gas utility, for example, might use a  ""floor"" to protect its revenue in the event of a mild winter. In exchange for a  premium similar to that paid on an insurance policy, Enron will compensate the  utility for every day between November and March on which the temperature rises  above a set level. The payments would make up for reduced gas sales.In  another form of contract called a swap, or collar, Enron will pay the gas  company a given amount if the number of warm days exceeds a set level. But if  the number of cold days exceeds a threshold, the gas company will make a  payment to Enron. The utility would not have to pay a premium as it would with  the floor, and if it had to pay Enron, the money would come from the extra  revenue received by selling more gas in a colder-than normal winter.To a  layman this might look like betting. ""We never use that word,"" says Ronn. ""The  worst we say is to  have a view. ""In practice, other parties are often  involved in such transactions, taking over the contractual obligation created by  Enron. So, in addition to placing its own bets, Enron serves as a middleman, the  way a stockbroker stands in the middle of a securities trade.Like many  middlemen, Enron has to be in a position to make good on any transaction should  either party default. Otherwise, it would be hard to make a market in these  products. In addition, says Ronn, Enron often has to pay out money before  receiving payment from another party. Finally, Enron needed large amounts of  capital to trade products in its own account, just as a Wall Street firm invests  in stocks on its own in addition to executing customers  trades. To accomplish  all this, Enron needed vast amounts of capital. ""You do need to have liquidity  in huge numbers,"" Ronn says.This created a dilemma. A public company can  raise capital by selling additional shares, but current shareholders don t like  that because the new shares dilute the value of their holdings. The alternative  is to borrow, but large debts hurt a company s credit rating, forcing it to pay  higher interest rates on its loans.Andrew S. Fastow, who became the  company s senior vice president of finance in 1990, found innovative ways to  issue new shares without dilution and to raise capital by selling old-fashioned  assets like power plants and pipelines.""He has invented a groundbreaking  strategy,"" Ted. A. Izatt, senior vice president at Lehman Brother s Inc., told  CFO Magazine in the fall of 1999. Or, as Enron president and CEO Jeffrey  K. Skilling told the magazine: ""We needed someone to rethink the entire  financing structure at Enron from soup to nuts. We didn t want someone stuck in  the past, since the industry of yesterday is no longer. Andy has the  intelligence and the youthful exuberance to think in new ways. He deserves every  accolade tossed his way.""Fastow, named chief financial officer in March  1998, told the magazine: ""We transformed finance into a merchant  organization?.Essentially, we would buy and sell risk positions."" A key to the  strategy: Move many of Enron s transactions ""off the balance sheet."" In part,  this involved exploiting a loophole in the securities and accounting  regulations. As noted earlier, debts accumulated by subsidiaries, partnerships  or other ""entities"" can be kept off the parent company s books so long as the  parent does not own more than 50% of the entity incurring the debt.By  using so-called unconsolidated subsidiaries, ""you do not make transparent either  the nature of the investment or the relationship between the parent and the  subsidiary,"" said Verrecchia. Heavy hitters such as Wall Street analysts and  major shareholders may have the clout to get a company to provide additional  information on subsidiaries. ""But if you re just an investor picking up Enron s  annual report, you are stuck,"" Verrecchia added.A Pattern of Sketchy  Details It has long been clear from company statements and SEC  filings that Enron s off-balance-sheet transactions were enormous, but details  were sketchy because Enron did not have to report them, and chose not to. By  this fall, however, it became obvious these transactions involved huge risks  when Enron acknowledged it had improperly kept some activity off its books.  Putting those debts and losses into Enron s financial statements last month  meant reducing shareholder equity by $1.2 billion. Corrected statements reduced  net income by $96 million for 1997, $113 million for 1998, $250 million for 1999  and $132 million for 2000.At issue were so-called ""special purpose  entities,"" or SPEs, set up for a variety of transactions for Enron s benefit.  Enron conceded some of these entities did not meet the accounting standards to  be kept off of Enron s books. In one case, for instance, the entity had  ""inadequate capitalization"" for such treatment.In 2000, Enron had  created four entities known as Raptor I, II, III and IV to ""hedge market risk in  certain of its investments,"" according to an Enron filing with the SEC. Enron  acquired notes receivable from the Raptors in exchange for an obligation to  issue Enron shares to the entities. But Enron had improperly included the value  of the notes receivable on its books without accounting for the cost of the  shares it would have to issue. In correcting this violation of accounting rules,  Enron said it had overstated its shareholders equity by $1 billion in March and  June 2001.Enron was particularly embarrassed in acknowledging that two  special purpose entities, limited partnerships LJM Cayman and LJM Co-Investment,  had Fastow as the managing partner. Fastow, who according to Enron made in  excess of $30 million in this role, was forced out of the company in October. An  internal committee and the SEC are investigating the use of the  partnerships.Obviously, Fastow s role was a problem. If the partnerships  were truly independent entities, he was in a conflict of interest. If he was  running them on Enron s behalf, they were not independent.Despite the  write-downs and disclosures this fall, many analysts complain they still do not  have a full picture of Enron s activities. Enron, for instance, has not fully  described other partnerships it believes it can properly keep off the balance  sheet. Nor is it clear to what extent Enron s losses are due to bad bets it had  made through highly-leveraged derivatives. While a stock market investor can  simply hang on to shares to wait out a downturn, options and other derivatives  typically have expiration dates. If the bet has not turned out as hoped, the  entire investment can be lost.""New disclosure was modest and management  did not resolve concerns,"" Goldman Sachs analysts David Maccarrone and David  Fleischer wrote in an Oct. 24 report to clients. Though Enron had long faced  such criticisms, investors had tended to give the company the benefit of the  doubt ""because of its strong growth in earnings and acknowledged industry  leading capabilities?,"" the two analysts said.In other words, when stock  was soaring, investors didn t require details on how it was done. Now they are  crying foul, and a number of shareholder suits have been filed. Essentially,  they claim the company inflated its stock price by filing false financial  statements. Investors who bought shares at those high prices have suffered huge  losses.For years, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, which sets  accounting rules, has had a draft proposal for improving disclosure of  subsidiaries  activities and numbers. Essentially, it would move toward a more  qualitative evaluation of whether the parent controlled the subsidiary even if  it owned less than 50% of the stock. Control could be exerted by holding board  seats or through contracts that effectively make the subsidiary a unit of the  parent.""What the FASB has promulgated seems to me to be sensible,""  Verrecchia said, noting that the whole purpose of accounting is to give an  accurate view of a company s inner workings and true earnings. To conceal  obligations, risk and debt, as Enron and others do, undermines that goal, he  said.But, facing heavy opposition from accountants and corporations, the  FASB has not acted on the draft proposal, citing insufficient support on its  board. So for the time being, off-balance-sheet transactions will continue to be  a common practice among American corporations."

Complaint My name is Vince Kaminski and I was quoted by Ms. Kristen Hays in her article on Enron (the link is provided below). Her behavior represents in my view a violation of ethical standards that every journalist should observe. I did not talk to Ms. Hays. She did not ask me any questions. She might have been the lady sitting at my table at the luncheon and she may have overheard bits and pieces of conversation I had with my friend. I shall be glad to submit the name of a witness who was talking to me  and sitting next to me through the entire meeting and who walked out with me from the building. I am not sure if an organization of your reputation can tolerate similar questionable practices of collecting information. Eavesdropping on a private conversation is not an acceptable behavior in a civilized society. If you would like to endorse such behavior, you should provide Ms. Hays with a hearing aid.

324262,2001-12-07 13:22:30,"This analysis was another swag at p&l components. We took the numbers from the daily position reports, backed out the big originations that we new about (e.g. peakers sales) and the other ""mistakes"" (e.g. the EES $700MM loss), then took out the curve-shift P&L from the backtest data, the balance we said must be some form of ""new deal"" P&L plus realised p&l etc.It shows that 2000 was the prop trading year, whereas 2001 was mainly new deals. Of course the whole thing is poisoned by reserve movements."

Those documents were not provided and therefore we cannot sign off on any analysis done in the past. I have come to a conclusion that we cannot support the valuations based on verbal and often conflicting information, without doing  full due diligence. Feel free to provide the information to Kimberly but, please, inform her I cannot support the quantitative analysis we have done in the past. I am especially concerned about the conflict between the existence of the restriction and the existence of a put that are, in my view, mutually exclusive.

In many cases the same point was made by more than one person.  The similar comments helped me decide what was important, but I selected just one version to include in the writing.  You may notice that I have edited your statements to reflect past tense and otherwise to improve the flow of the overall text.  My intention is not to change the meaning of what you said.Please look the quotes over and let me know if these words can be used as they are written as part of the writing or if you want to change anything.  In either case, please let me know by email or by phone ((713) 871-8345 before January 30th).   I have assembled a great description about your group using your collective words.  As of now, the sections include:Beginning Efforts Maintaining Effectiveness in Client Services Guiding Principles of the Operations Leadership Personal Characteristics and Interpersonal Dynamics Reflective Thoughts at the EndOnce I have approval from each of the 20 people who provided quotes, I will send an edited draft to Vince for his comments.  After that, I ll send the document to you for your comments.  Then I will focus on publication, although in the end, I expect that the document will have to be further pared to have a chance of being published.  I still believe that the experience of the Research Group was extraordinary in itself.  At the same time, the current publicity related to the larger Enron debacle may override the Research Group s story for a while.   In case you re wondering, I have not attempted to relate the Research Group story to current Enron issues in any way.    Thank you for your involvement,Ann Thomas    - Vince Quotes.doc"

He continues to cite the fact that he issues a $60 MM grty from WPS Resources, parent to Energy Services and the regulated Wisconsin Public Service. $60 MM is a far stretch for the value of the paper. As a recap of the WPS, I approached them about 2 months ago about renogiating the thresholds in the contract and executing an Enfolio. They said that they would look into it, but did not get back to me until all of the ""problems"" began to occur. Jeff and I spoke a few weeks ago we when he called for Adequate Assurances under a GISB that was assigned with CES purchased, but later terminated. I informed him that the contract was terminated and enlightened him to the fact that we were not currently margining him on the ISDA contract. He backed down. 2) Ashland Incorporated,  Sherry Tackett would like to work on netting the physical and financial payments and decided to withhold the payment so we can resolve the problem. For October business, Ashland owes Enron approx $946,000 bewteen ENA and ENA Upstream. The financial positions continue through Dec  03 with a current value of ($604,314). She would like to unwind and receive payment on the financial positions before she pays physical. She says she will pay interest on the unpaid invoice while we work on the issue. I politely explianed to her that withholding payment is not the best means to an end, but that we will explore alternatives.-Darren -----Original Message-----From: 	McFatridge, Thomas  Sent:	Tuesday, November 27, 2001 12:37 PMTo:	Vanek, DarrenCc:	Baxter, Bryce; Eubanks Jr., David W.Subject:	Ashland ChemicalDarren,I spoke with Sherry Tackett at Ashland.

(or its successor or its successor s parent company) shall have long-term, senior, unsecured debt not supported by third party credit enhancement that is rated by S&P below ""BBB-"" [also insert Moody s as appropriate];I understood yesterday that we may also need to consider changing the definition of Credit Support Provider in the ISDA s.

Let me know what else I need to do.ThanksDGI managed all back office issues of an asset management deal with Brooklyn Union Gas Company.  It was a two year deal in which Enron was assigned all of the utilities  assets (supply contracts, transportation contracts, and storage contracts) and then became responsible for providing 100% of the gas requirements of BUG.  I was involved in the negotiations to sign the deal, mostly working with the supply group of BUG doing due diligence on their contracts.  I created a complex invoice model and worked with our trading group, our logistics group, our risk management group, and gas accounting group.  In addition, I made monthly trips to New York to manage the customer and take care of any issues.  It was a $24MM/Year deal.  I was the point person on this deal and worked on it for a year and a half before handing it off to someone else when I moved to risk.I was involved in another asset management deal with Peoples Gas Company in Chicago.  I also did due diligence work and was involved in negotiations on the deal.  I also created invoice models.  I did not do the day to day work because I was on my way to risk management.  We started a joint venture with Peoples in Chicago.  I set up the risk management department and managed all mid and back office issues of the joint venture.  I managed two book administrators who worked in the Chicago office and made monthly visits to address any issues.  This office made $12MM in its first year and we had no issues from a risk management or accounting perspective.I took over managing the West desk in risk when there was a $10MM flash to actual variance in the region.  Flash to actual is the difference between the reported P&L and the GL.  Within 3 months I had identified the variances and cleared them.  On a going forward basis I kept the variance at zero.  I identified problems in scheduling that were causing these variances and took proactive steps to fix the problem.  After managing the desk for 6 months, I was able to have everyone cross trained on other books.  This resulted in me being able to reduce the staff by one, saving the company approx $100K/Year."

With three years at this company under my belt (not to mention being a part of the US s largest bankruptcy and finding my name on lists for the FBI, SEC and FERC), I must say it s been an interesting ride.  Regardless of the unpleasant course of events over the last six months I truly enjoyed my time with Enron and most importantly the people I got to know as a result.  You may be wondering where I am off to next...and I am more than happy to share.  I will be departing May 28th and winging my way to Paris (via a short stay in London).  I have decided to refer to this next move in my life as a sort of sabbatical.  Basically, I will be living in the heart of the city and taking language courses full-time...in-between the wine, cheese and museums of course!  Knowing how much people move around these days I wanted to make sure that everyone had my email address and encourage any of you who may be changing your own to let me know.Take care and Au Revoir,Susansusan_m_scott@hotmail.com"

348099,2002-02-20 12:38:51,"These are my notes on the Sonat Park & Loan.  I have not spoken with any legal counsel representing ENA.Summary:  Sonat has netted our Parked Gas Balance with our Loaned Gas Balance and filed a motion with the courts to retain the remaining Parked Gas Balance, 92,949 dth per my conversation with Sonat, to offset $879,030.42 ENA owes Sonat for the purchase of gas in October 2001.  According to Sonat, the payment was due November 26, 2001 but ENA did not pay.  Sonat s motion is set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th. ENA recognizes a balance of 197,537 dth - the difference is ENA is not netting the 96,000 dth Loan with the park and Sonat is showing an additional day of withdrawal of 8,588 dth in January 2002.Chris s notes:Sonat Park & Loans2/19/02  History  - Per Dave Dyer (205-326-2007) at Sonat ENA has 2 Park & Loan (PAL) contracts with Sonat.  All PAL s with Sonat are under master contract PAL1001.  Sonat assigns a deal number to each deal under this contract.  Deal #1424 - ENA borrowed a total of 96,000 dth from Nov 3rd-5th and has not paid this back.  ENA still owes Sonat 96,000 dth.  The terms of the deal were to payback Sonat anytime with 3 days notice on any 3 days on 2002,   SONAT ONLY CHARGED ENA $96.00 FOR THIS DEAL, because Sonat needed to get gas off the system.Deal #1222 - ENA parked 309,192 dth in August to come out in Jan 2002.  Sonat let ENA withdraw 42,951 on 11/29/01 leaving a balance of 266,241 dth.  In Jan 2002, ENA withdrew 8,588 dth per day for the 1st-9th.  That left a balance of 188,949 dth.  On Jan 8th, 2002, Sonat sent a letter stating that Sonat will hold on to the remaining to balance to offset 1) the Loaned gas on deal #1424 (96,000 dth) and 2) to offset dollars ENA has not paid Sonat for gas Sonat sold to ENA in October 2001.  According to Sonat, the remaining balance on this deal is 92,949 dth = [309,192 parked in Aug - 42,951 w/d in Nov - 77,292 w/d in Jan - 92,000 balance on #1424].  According to Sonat s letter, Sonat has filed the appropriate motion for court approval for the offsets.  According to Dave, ENA is being billed $.00305 x daily balance in this account.  ENA should have paid some bigger amount went the gas was parked in August.Other items;ENA purchased system supply from Sonat in October 2001.  ENA purchased 286,998 at an average price of $3.063 = $879,030.42.  According to Sonat, ENA did not pay for this before Enron declared bankruptcy.  ENA also sold Sonat gas - 16,000 dth day at $2.885 (sitara #1172076) in January 2002 and 10,000 dth day at $2.955 in May 2002 (sitara #1172087).  ENA used 77,292 dth (8,588 dth per day for Jan 1st - 9th) of the parked gas on deal #1222 to supply the 16,000 dth before Sonat stopped ENA from withdrawing from the park.  ENA defaulted on 418,708 dth of the Sonat deal in January.Sonat s in house legal counsel is Patti Frances (205-325-7696).  I left a message for Patti to call me.2/20/02Patti Frances returned my call.  Patti said the motion is currently set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th.  I asked Patti if there were any penalties for not performing on the Jan 2002 sale to Sonat and if Sonat was going to pay for the 77,292 dth that ENA did supply.  Patti said she didn t think there were penalties but she would verify that and see if they were going to pay.  I also asked her if Sonat is still honoring the ENA sale to Sonat in May 2002 and if Sonat would pay ENA if ENA performed.  She will check on it and call me back."

Just wanted to drop you a line and say hi. Everything with me is fine and I have several options in front of me. The next few months will probably be pretty frustrating but I am confident everything will work out in the end. As far a snowboarding I m not sure if I am going to be able to get out before christmas. I am coming to Red Deer on Saturday for the night and will pick up my board but the girl I am seeing is going home for XMas on the 20th and I think it would be bad if I made plans to going skiing next weekend.

364458,2001-12-13 09:58:21,X-FileName: chris dorland 6-26-02.PSTHi everyone!Once again I find myself being tasked by Geof Storey. Houston has requested that we make lists of all applications that we use and also that we consolidate all of the files (models and data) that are critical to our business (I don t think MP3 s count) into one directory on the network. This is so that these items can be included in the proposed deal with newco. The Calgary Trading group has set up a directory on I:/trading/newco and I think if each group did the same that would be great. Each group should probably have one person in charge of the directory so there isn t any overlap. Call me with any ? s/Thanx Chris

But if that was to fall through, Canada would attempt to find its own white knight, so to speak. We had numerous expressions of interest and none of those have been pursued at this time.""Houston-based Enron Corp. was negotiating yesterday with at least six potential buyers for its wholesale trading business in an auction that was part of efforts to reorganize itself under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The auction was expected to continue into the evening.In Manhattan, U.S. bankruptcy judge Arthur J. Gonzalez scheduled a hearing for today to approve the sale.Enron Canada was Canada s largest market maker of natural gas and power until it was swept up in the failure of its indirect parent, which unraveled after disclosures that Enron Corp. had shifted billions of dollars in debt off its books. It was left saddled with at least US$40-billion in debt.Enron Corp. s troubles deepened this week with revelations that the U.S. Justice Department has begun a criminal investigation. There was also an admission yesterday by the firm that audited Enron s books, Arthur Andersen LLP, that a ""significant but undetermined"" number of documents related to the company had been destroyed.Mr. Milnthorp said the investigation ""has nothing to do with Enron Canada.""The Canadian unit attempted last month to distance itself from the parent and re-emerge as an independent company but gave up after losing a bid in an Alberta court to keep counterparties from unwinding contracts, its major asset.Mr. Milnthorp said the Canadian arm was packaged as part of a deal to sell Enron s overall trading business, which buys and sells oil, petroleum products, natural gas, electricity, metals, coal, forest products and steel, and a variety of contracts and derivatives. The company would get cash and a 49% stake in a new partnership called ""Netco,"" short for New Energy Trading Company, under the proposed sale. The trading unit generated about 90% of Enron Corp. s US$100.8- billion in revenue in 2000.Mr. Milnthorp said 75 employees in Calgary and Toronto were laid off after last month s court proceedings and trading was suspended because of lack of confidence in the market.""To be successful in this business, you need a very solid balance sheet that creates the confidence necessary to enter into long-term transactions. That s been one of the key criteria through the auction process,"" he said.Enron Canada s remaining employees are ""trying to manage the estate and trying to work hard to co-operate with our customers to get them paid,"" he said.The unit is cash rich from the sale last month of its interest in the Sundance B power-generating plant outside of Edmonton.Bidders for all or parts of the trading operation include Citigroup Inc., the largest financial services company, UBS AG, the largest Swiss bank, and BP PLC, one of the largest oil and gas companies.ccattaneo@nationalpost.com <mailto:ccattaneo@nationalpost.com>"

(ENE) Chief Executive Kenneth Lay couldreceive a lump sum payment as much as $80 million as a result of Dynegy Inc. s(DYN) plan to acquire Enron, according to a regulatory filing released Tuesdayby the Securities and Exchange Commission.   Under Lay s employment agreement, which originally extended through Dec. 31,2003, Lay was entitled to a lump sum payment equal to the number of fullcalendar years remaining under his contract multiplied by $20.2 million if heterminated his employment within 60 days of a change of control.   In August, Lay, chairman of Enron, resumed his position as CEO following theresignation of Jeffrey K. Skilling, Enron s then-president and CEO. At thattime, his contract was extended to Dec. 31, 2005.   In addition to the lump sum payment, Lay is entitled to an amount for anyrelated tax penalties if the payment were held to constitute an ""excessparachute payment,"" according to the filing.   Dynegy plans to acquire Enron in a stock swap valued around $10.12 billion.   The deal is expected to close sometime next year, in which case Lay isentitled to $60.6 million under his contract if he terminates his employmentwithin the 60 days.

It s an excerpt from an analyst s noteout this AM.A Perspective: R.I.P. Enron:It took sixteen years to build Enron into a $63 billion asset powerhouse,but only 24 days for it to disintegrate.The fatal flaw was the aggressive accounting and leveraging done in variousoff balance sheet partnerships (Special Purpose Entities), which apparentlybecame too aggressive to fully disclose. Wall Street had no idea of their holdings,their leverage or their derivative exposures. The SPEs mutated intosomething beyond the pale, becoming a company within a company. This evidently began30 months ago when the new management regime (Skilling, Fastow, et al)sanctioned their evolution. Make no mistake: they were cleverly contrived. Theyinvolved conventional asset & debt transfers off the books, coupled with fair value(asset mark-to-market) accounting and synthetic equity financing. Thisallowed for considerable earnings management and the appearance of cost-free equity.If nothing else, they now appear in hindsight to have been vanity deals: veryNew Economy, very Virtual and very aggressive. But no clients ever complained,to our knowledge. Yet ENE clearly crossed the GAAP reporting lines, as thelatest 8-K attests, and the dual role of the CFO (sitting on both sides of thetable in the LJM transactions), profiting highly in the process, created in the LJMpartnership natural conflicts of interest now being investigated by the SEC.Because of this elementary mistake in any seasoned judgment, which passedmuster at every level, the most successful energy company of the 90s was vaporizedin the marketplace. The main thing that brought ENE down was hubris. It hadused up all of its credibility when the partnerships were brought to light. If thesewere fully revealed two years ago, a collapse would have been very unlikely.Rob LloydAIM Management713-214-4355"

Here are my notes.  Did not yet have a chance to organize them, so they re simply in chronological order.The call began with Watson, Bergstrom, and Whalley reading from prepared statements.  Watson spoke for c. 10 minutes, Bergstrom for 5, and Whalley spoke for perhaps 30 seconds.  Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call.  Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them.  Specific points:EES will be a part of the new company.  Enron assets will be revalued at closing.  The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred.  If the merger does not go through, Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for  very little  additional consideration.  If DYN terminates the merger and ENE  has sufficient liquidity , ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred.  Debt/equity of combined company expected to be <45%.Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative.  ChevronTexaco will hold 169MM shares out of a total 650MM shares of the post-merger entity.  Watson reiterates that going forward, the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure, with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage.  In what was termed a ""new approach"", the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings.  Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true.  Dynegy owed Enron <$50MM.  Lay says that Enron had other options,  particularly financial .All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks.Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be  pretty big , but that the companies feel they re able to appropriately value this exposure.Lay says we have nothing else to hide, but internal investigation still under way.  Lay:  had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps $30MM more of risk capital, there would have been no question that they would have qualified for off-balance-sheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs.Dynegy says that  several  internal investigations continue at Enron, and thus DYN/ENE cannot say with certainty that there s absolutely nothing else out there.Doty (Dynegy CFO) says that late last week, ENE had  close to a billion  in cash.  Osprey will be unwound late next summer. Marlin will be unwound after closing.Many of the off-balance-sheet structures, including the credit-linked notes, are expected to be unwound/redeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing.With regard to ENE asset dispositions, these will be accelerated to the extent possible.  However, Doty says that  our backs are not against the wall , and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash.ENE will renew its 364-day facility (believe this is the $3Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago) within the next 6-8 weeks.  BBB-flat most likely rating for combined entity, according to initial comments from ratings agencies.McMahon says  no comment  to WSJ article indicating that ENE s banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks.Consolidation of trading activity: Mid- and back-office consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing, such that only the front office / trading books will need to be combined at closing.  EES, NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity, so there won t be much integration work required there.  The big integration effort will be ENA.Watson says that the  creative financing  surrounded non-core assets.  Doty adds that,  frankly , DYN assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model.  They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assets/businesses and left it at that.Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by  Enron s top three executives , who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies.  Says that their approach evidenced a  willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegy s deliberations on proceeding with the merger.Watson/Doty said that they re NOT 100% sure that no surprises remain in Enron s books--but that the risk/reward offered by the combination was compelling. The deal does have material-adverse-change outs for Dynegy, covering any MAC regarding Enron s assets or businesses.  Dynegy s lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a  blunt instrument  under which it would be difficult to bring a case, so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enron s total legal liability (from any source or cause of action) tops $3.5Bn prior to closing.McMahon adds that there  could  be more restatements, but he  does not expect  there to be more restatements.ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list.The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron.Enron is planning to hold an Enron-specific conference call in the next few days, tentatively scheduled for Wednesday.Initial reaction of ratings agencies  very positive  to combined entities.  McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end, had the merger not materialized.Dynegy s earnings guidance places Enron-related earnings accretion at $0.90-0.95, which represents a  25% haircut  to Enron internal estimates.  Doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies.Doty says that both Enron and Dynegy s books, as far as he understands, are relatively short-term in weight, and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity.  Says a  very very substantial  portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash.ChevronTexaco s investment in Dynegy was calculated at a 5% discount to public prices on the date of negotiation (not disclosed).  Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week, ChevronTexaco s investment is now at a  more substantial  discount to market prices.  ChevronTexaco has provision to get  different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better .  (No further clarification given).Whalley believes that  we ll retain  the Enron traders and marketers. They re used to being part of a winning team, and the combined entity will definitely be a winner.  They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders, and they are  very excited  by the combination.  They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained.  Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions.  He says that  to the extent necessary, yes. Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENE--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus, but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the Dynegy of today.Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture, he s a strong team player.  He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well.Give me a call if you d like me to try to clarify any of these comments.Patrick Tuckerx3-3055"

Now its stock is down, wall street is be=arish, and the CEO is gone. What went wrong?by Mimi Swartz </mag/issues/authors/mimiswartz.php>THE ENRON SKYSCRAPER NEAR THE SOUTH END OF HOUSTON S DOWNTOWN feels like th=e international headquarters of the best and the brightest. The lobby in no= way resembles the hushed, understated entryways of the old-fashioned oil c=ompanies, like Shell and Texaco nearby. Enron, in contrast, throbs with mod=ernity. The people hustling in and out of the elevators are black, white, b=rown; Asian, Middle Eastern, European, African, as well as American-born. T=hey are young, mostly under 35, and dressed in the aggressively casual unif=orm of the tech industry-the guys wear khakis, polo shirts, and Banana Repu=blic button-downs. Almost preposterously fit, they move through the buildin=g intently, like winners. Enron is nothing if not energetic: A Big Brother-=size TV screen frantically reports on the stock market near a bank of eleva=tors, while another hefty black television relaying the same news greets pe=ople entering from the garage. A sculpture of the corporate symbol, an E ti=pped at a jaunty angle, radiates colors as it spins frenetically on its axi=s; a Starbucks concession on the ground floor keeps everyone properly caffe=inated. Multicolored, inspirational flags hang from the ceiling, congratula=ting Enron on its diversity and its values; one more giant banner between e=levator banks declares Enron s simple if grandiose goal: ""From the World s =Leading Energy Company to . . . The World s Leading Company!""For a while, that future seemed guaranteed, as Enron transformed itself fro=m a stodgy, troubled pipeline company in 1985 to a trading colossus in 2000=. It was a Wall Street darling, with a stock price that increased 1,700 per=cent in that sixteen-year period, with revenues that increased from $40 bil=lion to $100 billion. ""The very mention of the company in energy circles th=roughout the world creates reactions ranging from paralyzing fear to envy,""= notes a 2001 report from Global Change Associates, a firm that provides ma=rket intelligence to the energy business.This Enron was largely the creation of Jeff Skilling, a visionary determine=d to transform American business. Hired sixteen years ago as a consultant b=y then-CEO Ken Lay, Skilling helped build a company that disdained the old =formula of finding energy in the ground, hauling it in pipelines, and then =selling it to refineries and other customers. Instead, it evolved into a co=mpany that could trade and market energy in all its forms, from natural gas= to electricity, from wind to water. If you had a risky drilling venture, E=nron would fund it for a piece of the action. If you wanted your megacorpor=ation s energy needs analyzed and streamlined, Enron could do the job. If y=ou were a Third World country with a pitiful infrastructure and burgeoning =power needs, Enron was there to build and build. Basically, if an idea was =new and potentially-and fantastically-lucrative, Enron wanted the first cra=ck. And with each success, Enron became ever more certain of its destiny. T=he company would be the bridge between the old economy and the high-tech wo=rld, and in February of this year, Skilling reaped his reward when he succe=eded Lay as chief executive officer. Enron, says Skilling, ""was a great mar=riage of the risk-taking mentality of the oil patch with the risk-taking me=ntality of the financial markets.""The Enron story reflects the culture that drove American business at the en=d of the twentieth century. Like the high-tech companies it emulated, Enron= was going to reinvent the American business model and, in turn, the Americ=an economy. Maybe it was natural that this Brave New World also produced a =culture that was based on absolutes: not just the old versus the new, but t=he best versus the mediocre, the risk takers versus the complacent-those wh=o could see the future versus those who could not. The key was investing in= the right kind of intellectual capital. With the best and the brightest, a= company couldn t possibly go wrong.Or could it? Today Enron s stock trades at around $35, down from a high of =$80 in January. The press cast Enron as the archvillain of California s ene=rgy crisis last spring, and Skilling caught a blueberry pie in the face for= his relentless defense of the free market. A long-troubled power plant pro=ject in India threatened the company s global ambitions. Telecommunications=, in which Enron was heavily invested, imploded. Wall Street analysts who o=nce touted the company questioned its accounting practices. Some of the cha=nge in Enron s fortunes can be attributed to the economic downturn in uncer=tain times that has afflicted all of American business. But the culture tha=t the company created and lived by cannot escape blame.ENRON, JEFF SKILLING SAYS, HAD ""a totally different way of thinking about b=usiness-we got it."" At Enron, in fact, you either ""got it"" or you were gone=-it was as simple as black and white. It is not coincidental, then, that th=e color scheme of Skilling s River Oaks mansion mirrors the corporation he =once headed. Here, the living room s white walls shimmer against the mahoga=ny floors. Black leather trims the edge of snowy carpets. Billowy sofas set= off the jet-black baby grand. In the entry, white orchids cascade from a b=lack vase on a black pedestal table that in turn pools onto cold, white mar=ble. There is only one off-color note: After almost twenty years, Jeff Skil=ling is no longer associated with Enron, having resigned abruptly after jus=t six months as CEO. Once, Skilling was hailed as the next Jack Welch (Gene=ral Electric s masterful CEO), as one of Worth magazine s best CEO s in Ame=rica (anointed in 2001), and even as a daredevil who hosted the kind of unc=hained adventure junkets in which, a friend told BusinessWeek, ""someone cou=ld actually get killed."" Today, he sounds more like Ebenezer Scrooge on Chr=istmas morning. ""I had no idea what I d let go of,"" Skilling says of all th=e personal sacrifices he made while retooling Enron.=20From a black chair in the white library, across from a huge black and white= photograph of his daughter and two sons, Skilling clarifies. The demands o=f working 24-7 for Enron caused him to ignore his personal finances. Divorc=ed, he lived in a 2,200-square-foot house without a microwave or a dishwash=er. He almost missed his brother s wedding. ""Learning a foreign language-I =never learned a foreign language!"" he exclaims. He never once took his youn=gest son to school. ""I m interested in the kids. You don t do kids in fifte=en-minute scheduling."" Travel: ""You can t go to Africa for a week and get a=nything out of it!"" Skilling includes the study of architecture and design =on his list of missed opportunities, then he stops and sighs. ""I m not sure= that fulfillment in life is compatible with a CEO s job,"" he says, finally=. Then his eyes lock on mine, and his voice, which had softened, regains it=s pragmatic edge. ""It would have been easy to stay,"" he says. ""But that wou=ld not have been good for me.""=20He s a smallish, ruddy-faced man who keeps himself at fighting weight, hand=some in the way of corporate titans, with piercing cheekbones and that assi=duously stolid gaze. But the impatience Skilling once reserved for cautious= underlings and dull-witted utility company executives is now targeted at r=eporters who have labeled his resignation ""bizarre"" and associates who are =bitterly skeptical of his need for family time. His shrug stretches the lim=its of his shimmering blue button-down, and his matching blue eyes look put= upon. ""I m surprised,"" he says, ""that people have so much trouble understa=nding this.""PEOPLE WHO PASSED THROUGH DOWNTOWN HOUSTON in the late eighties or early ni=neties couldn t help but notice a funny and, for its time, novel scene unfo=lding throughout the workday at the base of the Enron Building. From nine t=o five and before and after, you could see people slipping out of the prist=ine silver skyscraper to smoke. They perched on the chrome banisters or lur=ked near the glass doors at the entry, puffing like mad. They always looked= hurried and furtive, even ashamed. Whatever people knew about Enron in tho=se days (and most people didn t know much), it was often associated with th=at scene: Enron boasted one of the first nonsmoking corporate headquarters =in Houston, and there couldn t have been clearer evidence of its break with= the energy world of the past. What macho engineer would have put up with s=uch humiliation?But this company was a child of another time, that period in the mid-eighti=es when chaos enveloped the gas business. Federal deregulation of natural g=as turned a steady, secure industry, in which gas pipeline companies freque=ntly enjoyed a monopoly in portions of the areas that they served, into a v=olatile free-for-all. The situation was compounded five years later by fede=ral deregulation of the pipeline business. So it happened that a gentlemanl=y gas pipeline company, Houston Natural Gas (HNG) found itself under attack= from Coastal Corporation, Oscar Wyatt s less than gentlemanly firm. HNG wa=s then run by Lay, a sturdy, taciturn former economics professor and Transc=o chief operating officer who had a passion for military strategy. (His doc=toral thesis at the University of Houston was on supply and demand in the V=ietnam War.) Lay, who was from Missouri and never succumbed-at least outwar=dly-to Texas brashness, had done well enough: Thanks to canny expansions, H=NG s pipelines stretched from Florida to California and throughout the stat=e of Texas.HNG fended off Coastal, but to protect the company from other takeover atte=mpts, Lay nimbly engineered the sale of HNG in 1985 to a friendly Nebraska =pipeline concern called InterNorth, one of the largest pipeline companies i=n the country at the time. Then, a funny thing happened: HNG started acting= in a way that would characterize the company for years to come-a lot like =Coastal. What the Nebraskans blithely labeled ""the purchase"" was being call=ed ""the merger"" back in Houston, and before long, following some particular=ly brutal politicking between Omaha and Houston, the company s center of gr=avity started shifting toward Texas, and shortly after that, Ken Lay was ru=nning a new company called Enron. ""Over time it became clear that Lay had a= better vision of the future,"" says one person associated with Enron at tha=t time. ""He never fought change. He embraced change.""Lay had won, but what exactly did that mean? Enron was saddled with massive= debt from the takeover attempt, and thanks to deregulation, no longer had =exclusive use of its pipelines. Without new ideas-for that matter, a whole =new business plan-the company could be finished before it really even got s=tarted.=20LIKE MANY PEOPLE WHO TEAMED UP WITH ENRON IN THE EIGHTIES, Jeff Skilling ha=d spent a lot of time in the Midwest, and he was self-made-at fourteen he h=ad been the chief production director at a start-up TV station in Aurora, I=llinois. (His mother would drop him off there every day after school.) ""I l=iked being successful when I was working, and I was smart,"" he told Busines=sWeek earlier this year. But unlike many of his Enron colleagues, Skilling =wasn t deliberate and soft-spoken and happy to go home at five o clock; he =was anxious and excitable, and nothing, but nothing excited him more than w=hat he would come to call ""intellectual capital."" He loved being smart, and= he loved being surrounded by smart people. He graduated from Southern Meth=odist University, went into banking-assets and liability management-and too=k on Harvard Business School, where he graduated in the top 5 percent of hi=s class. Then Skilling took the next step on what was then the new, souped-=up path to American success: He joined Manhattan s McKinsey and Company as =a business consultant, and that is where Ken Lay found him in 1985.=20It is often said of Lay that his instincts for hiring the best are flawless=, and his choice of Skilling probably saved the company. Skilling was above= all an expert at markets and how they worked. While everyone else was worr=ying about the gluts and the shortages that defined the gas industry, he al=one saw the parallels between gas and other businesses. And so in a world w=here credit was nearly impossible to come by, Skilling came up with what he= called the Gas Bank, which contractually guaranteed both the supply and th=e price of gas to a network of suppliers and consumers. Enron would not be =a broker but a banker. It would buy and sell the gas itself and assume the =risk involved. And Enron would make money on transactions, much like an inv=estment bank would.Skilling worked up some numbers and found them ""absolutely compelling."" The=n the McKinsey consultant took the idea to a meeting of about 25 Enron exec=utives. He had a one-page presentation. ""Almost to a person,"" Skilling says=, ""they thought it was stupid."" Almost. After Skilling left the meeting dej=ected, he walked Ken Lay to an elevator and apologized. Lay listened and th=en said, ""Let s go.""The Gas Bank was not an overnight success. For months Skilling woke up in a= cold sweat, sure he had ruined not only his career but the careers of doze=ns of colleagues who had assisted him. In fact, he had come upon one of tho=se divides that seem to define his life: ""I believed this whole world would= be different, a huge breakthrough"" is the way Skilling puts it today, and =even if he is typically immodest, he was right. Fairly soon after launching=, the company sold $800 million worth of gas in a week. True to Skilling s =character, success turned out to be a matter of old versus new: He says the= joke around Enron was that if a company s CEO was under fifty, ""We were in=."" And he was in too: In 1990 Skilling finally left McKinsey and joined Enr=on as the head of Enron Finance Corporation, a new division created just fo=r him. In 1991 that company closed a deal that earned $11 million in profit=. After that, says Skilling, ""we never looked back.""Skilling and Lay also realized that the Gas Bank couldn t work unless it ha=d a trading component. Myriad trades were needed to build the market that w=ould make the project go. But by buying and selling enormous quantities of =gas, Enron not only constructed a market but almost instantly came to domin=ate it. The company had the best contacts, the best intelligence, and the b=est access to supplies. That, in turn, attracted more customers who wanted =to be part of the play. With so many customers in its pocket, Enron could b=etter predict the direction of the market and could use that knowledge to m=ake trades for its own benefit-Enron could in effect bet on which way the p=rice of gas would go, as one might do with pork bellies or soybeans, but wi=th startling accuracy, thereby generating profits higher than anyone could =have ever imagined.THIS CHANGE COULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED without another change Skilling had m=ade: He created, within Enron, a new culture to match its new trading busin=ess. The idea was to build a ""knowledge-based business,"" which demanded a s=kill set not exactly prized by Enron s employees from the old HNG days. Mos=t were deliberate, cautious, responsible, somewhat defensive people, most o=f them men, of course-the kind of people you d expect to find working in an= industry regulated by the federal government. But now the company needed b=older people for its bold new era: that included anyone who wanted to make =money-lots of money-for themselves and for the company. ""Enron was going to= create a niche for itself or die,"" one former executive explains. ""The peo=ple who had narrow views eventually were forced out, because if they had na=rrow views about other things, they had narrow views about the market.""Skilling wanted smart people but not just any smart people. He wanted the s=martest people from schools like Harvard, Stanford, and maybe, Rice. And be=cause his firm was now acting more like a bank than a pipeline company, he =wanted to draw from the pool of recruits that would be attracted to the big=gest and best investment banks, like Merrill Lynch or Credit Suisse First B=oston. In addition to being smart, Enron people were also supposed to be ""a=ggressive."" You were right for Enron if you didn t want to wait until you w=ere thirty to close your own deals or move up in an organization.=20You could see what he was looking for on ""Super Saturdays"" at the Houston h=eadquarters: eight fifty-minute interviews with ten minute breaks in betwee=n-the company might herd as many as four hundred people through in just one= day. They were scored from 1 to 5 on their smarts, their problem-solving a=bility, their passion for hard work, and what at Enron was called ""a sense =of urgency."" People who scored less than 2.5 were scratched. The shrewdest =candidates knew how to work Enron before they were even hired: These were t=he types that automatically turned down the company s first offer, knowing =Enron would come back with more. The starting salary was around $80,000. Ma=ybe it wasn t a fortune-yet-but the signing bonus, about $20,000, was more =than enough for a lease on the obligatory Porsche Boxster or one of the lof=ts being renovated close to downtown. (Enron people didn t live in far-flun=g suburbs. Suburbs were uncool and too far from the office.)For the lucky winners, Enron offered the corporate equivalent of a gifted-a=nd-talented program. New associates learned the latest techniques for struc=turing energy deals, and there were rotations at Enron offices around the g=lobe. The hours were long, but every possible need was taken care of. A com=pany concierge handled all the things important people couldn t be bothered= with: picking up dry cleaning or prescriptions, shining shoes, cleaning th=e house, planning a vacation. Of course, a lot of people who worked for Enr=on never got to take vacations-they were too busy making money-but they cou=ld use the company gym and the company s personal trainers. If they were ov=erweight or wanted to quit smoking, they could join Enron s Wellness Progra=m. Massages were offered six days a week, from seven in the morning until t=en at night. ""They were so cutting edge,"" rhapsodizes someone involved with= the company health care program at the time. ""They really thought about th=e psychology and what it took to keep these people going.""Skilling handed out titles analogous to those at Wall Street firms-analysts=, associates, directors, and managing directors-but everyone knew that thos=e titles didn t really matter. Money did. Instead of competitive salaries a=nd decent bonuses, Enron offered competitive salaries and merit-based bonus=es-with no cap. ""If you really worked hard and delivered results, you could= make a lot of money,"" says Ken Rice, who stayed with Enron for 21 years un=til resigning recently as the head of the company s faltering broadband div=ision. Or, as the saying goes, you got to eat what you killed. Gas traders =with two or three years of experience could wind up with a $1 million bonus=. And the more you produced, the closer you got to Jeff: Real hot dogs join=ed him glacier hiking in Patagonia, Land Cruiser racing in Australia, or of=f-road motorcycling in a re-creation of the Baja 1,000 race, ending at a sp=ectacular Mexican villa. ""Every time he d speak, I d believe everything he =d say,"" one loyalist says.=20And why not? By 1995 Enron had become North America s largest natural-gas m=erchant, controlling 20 percent of the market. But at a company where the b=uzzword was ""aggressive,"" that was no place to stop: Skilling and Lay belie=ved the Gas Bank model could easily be applied to the electricity business.= Firmly committed to the notion that a deregulated market meant better serv=ice at lower prices for consumers (and untold profits for Enron), they bega=n barnstorming the country, pressing their case with entrenched power compa=ny presidents (who, with their multimillion-dollar salaries and monopoly se=rvice areas, had little incentive to change) and energy regulators (who wer=e somewhat more receptive, thanks in part to Enron s generous lobbying effo=rts).But the biggest winner of all was probably Jeff Skilling. In 1997 Ken Lay m=ade him the president and chief operating officer of the company. By then, =the division known as Enron Capital and Trade Resources was the nations lar=gest wholesale buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity. The divisio=n had grown from two hundred to two thousand employees, and revenues from $=2 billion to $7 billion. ""Mr. Skilling s experience so far with the turmoil= in the industry has convinced him that he is on the right track,"" the New =York Times noted. Everyone would certainly have thought so: Enron and Skill=ing had totally transformed one industry and were well on their way to tran=sforming another.""FIRING UP AN IDEA MACHINE; Enron Is Encouraging the Entrepreneurs Within,""= sang the New York Times in 1999. ""In the staid world of regulated utilitie=s and energy companies, Enron Corp is that gate-crashing Elvis,"" crowed For=tune in 2000. Wall Street was demanding tech-size growth on a tech timetabl=e, and Enron, in 2000, obliged with second quarter earnings of $289 million=, up 30 percent from the previous year. That year the company seemed to dis=cover a market a minute: Under Skilling, Enron was trading coal, paper, ste=el, and even weather. No one blinked when a London wine bar became an Enron= client. People drank more in warm weather than cold, so why not buy a hedg=e against the usual winter downturn?But most exciting to the financial world was Enron s entry into high-tech c=ommunications. Because of the company s marketing dominance, EnronOnline be=came another overnight success, handling $335 billion in commodity trades o=nline in 2000. Enron, as usual, made its money on the spread between the bi=d price and the asking price. Then there was the broadband business: To Enr=on, trading excess capacity in large, high-speed fiber-optic networks (empt=y lanes on the fabled information highway) wasn t that different from tradi=ng the capacity of natural gas pipelines. So Enron created a market for wha=t the industry calls bandwidth. Soon after, it also announced a twenty-year= deal with Blockbuster to deliver movies on demand electronically to people= in their homes. Enron looked like a company that couldn t lose. ""Its strat=egy of building businesses, shedding hard assets, and trading various commo=dities can help it do well even in an uncertain market,"" BusinessWeek insis=ted.There was, however, another reason Enron did so well in such a short time: =the company s hard-nosed approach toward its customers. The old notion of c=ustomer service was based on the long haul-you had to nurse and coddle cust=omers to keep them. But Enron had new markets and new ideas-customers had t=o come to it. Over time, the company stopping referring to its business cli=ents as customers and began calling them ""counterparties.""Skilling wanted the biggest profits on the shortest timetable: Gains were m=aximized by creating, owning, and then abandoning a market before it became= overtaxed and overregulated. So if you wanted to launch a high-risk ventur=e quickly-such as Zilkha Energy s new high-tech approach to drilling for oi=l-you got your financing from Enron because a bank would take forever to un=derwrite the project, if it ever would. But because Enron invented its mark=ets and subsequently dominated them, Enron could set the terms of its deals=, from the timeline to the method of accounting to whether the deal happene=d at all.=20While many businesses used what was known in the industry as ""mark-to-marke=t accounting,"" for instance, Enron used it on an unprecedented scale. The c=ompany priced their deals at current market value-but it was always Enron s= idea of the market value; companies that balked at their pricing didn t ge=t deals. And while old-fashioned companies spread their profits out like an=nuities over a period of years, Enron took most of its profit up-front. How=ever many millions would be made on a deal that covered several years, they= went on the books in the current year. If a few analysts thought there mig=ht be something fishy about what they called ""subjective accounting,"" inves=tors didn t particularly care as long as the profits rolled in. As the mark=et fluctuated and the landscape changed, the company might abandon a projec=t that had been in the works for months because its profit margins weren t =going to be high enough. ""Enron is known for leaving people at the altar,"" =says one former employee. Winning the highest possible profits for the comp=any could even extend to Enron s attitude toward charity. When a fundraiser= for the Houston READ Commission, a literacy group, called on Enron for a c=ontribution, it was suggested that he start raising money for Enron s compe=ting literacy charity: ""Even the person who was supposed to give money away= for Enron was supposed to make money for Enron,"" he says.As Enron became more and more successful, the culture Skilling had created =took on a dark side: The competition turned inward. As one member of the En=ron family put it, ""It became a company full of mercenaries."" The change st=arted at the bottom. As Enron s domination of the energy market grew, most =of the recruiting frills fell away. New associates were treated much like t=he commodities the company traded. Global Change s Enron spies reported ove=rhearing orders like ""I need a smart person-go buy me one"" or ""Buy me an in=telligent slave, quick."" Enron had never been the kind of place where peopl=e sang to you on your birthday, but now the workaholism bordered on self-pa=rody: A Random Acts of Kindness program lasted only a few months. It was to=o disruptive. People couldn t get their work done.And, of course, Enron had a program for institutionalizing creative tension=. The Performance Review Committee, which had initially been installed by S=killing in the Capital group, became known as the harshest forced ranking s=ystem in the country. Employees were rated on a scale of one to five, and t=hose with fives were usually gone within six months. (The PRC s nickname qu=ickly became ""rank and yank."") It was a point of pride that Skilling s divi=sion replaced 15 percent of its workforce every year. As one Skilling assoc=iate put it, ""Jeff viewed this like turning over the inventory in a grocery= store."" Skilling s approach to business-get in and get out-had become Enro=n s attitude toward its workers. In time, it would become many workers  att=itude toward the company. Teamwork, never that valuable in a trading cultur=e, went the way of the eyeshade and the abacus. If protocol required an Enr=on higher-up to come from Europe to help with a project in the Third World,= he might help-or he might not, depending on whether another, potentially m=ore lucrative project was pending elsewhere.Everyone felt the pressure to perform on a massive scale at massive speed: =""They were so goal oriented toward immediate gratification that they lost s=ight of the future,"" says one former employee. Anyone who couldn t close de=als within a quarter was punished with bad PRC scores, as were the higher-u=ps who had backed them. Past errors and old grudges were dredged up so ofte=n as new ammunition in PRC meetings that the phrase ""No old tapes"" became a=n Enron clich?. ""People went from being geniuses to idiots overnight,"" says= one former Enron executive.In such a hothouse, paranoia flowered. New contracts contained highly restr=ictive confidentiality agreements about anything pertaining to the company.= E-mail was monitored. A former executive routinely carried two laptops, on=e for the company and one for himself. People may have been rich at Enron, =but they weren t necessarily happy. One recruiter described the culture thi=s way: ""They roll you over and slit your throat and watch your eyes while y=ou bleed to death.""BEFORE JEFF SKILLING COULD TRANSFORM ENRON from the world s leading energy =company into the world s leading company, he had to make one more change: J=ust as he had done ten years before, Skilling had to purge the company of i=ts remaining old order. Where Enron once prized cautious executives who dea=lt with tangible assets like pipelines, it now valued bold executives who d=ealt with intangible assets. Pipelines, power plants-they may have been Enr=on s pride, but Skilling wanted them gone. Expensive, long-term building pr=ojects had no place when Wall Street was devoted to quick profits and enorm=ous returns on investment capital, and Skilling knew it. ""It wasn t the tim=e for long-term approaches,"" an Enron executive says of Wall Street s mood.= ""It was the technology era.""To rid Enron of the last vestiges of its past, Skilling had to take on Rebe=cca Mark, long considered his rival for the CEO s job. Mark was for many ye=ars the poster child for the Enron way: Young, attractive, aggressive-her n=ickname was Mark the Shark-she came from sturdy Midwestern stock but had th=e requisite Harvard MBA. Mark was largely responsible for the success of En=ron International, the asset-heavy side of the company where she developed =$20 billion worth of gas and power plants, which accounted for 40 percent o=f Enron s profits in 1998. For this she reaped breathtaking compensation-on=e Enron executive estimated $10 million-and adoring press clips, including =two appearances on Fortune s list of the fifty most powerful women in corpo=rate America.But then Mark ran into trouble with a gas-fired power plant in Dabhol, Indi=a, one of the largest ever constructed. She had played the game the Enron w=ay: Taking Enron into a new market, she had finagled low import taxes (20 p=ercent instead of the usual 53) and hung in through 24 lawsuits and three c=hanges in government. But the time and expense needed to make India and oth=er Enron plants around the globe successful did not mesh with Enron s goals=, and Skilling s impatience with Mark grew.Forcing Mark out, however, was no easy matter. Key executives left, divisio=ns were dismantled, but she remained. The truth was Enron didn t mind firin=g lower-level employees, but it hated to fire the kind of aggressive, relen=tless people it tended to promote. The company preferred humiliation-keepin=g a director in his cubicle, say, but failing to include him in the glamour= deals, or kicking someone upstairs with a fancy title. (One particularly d=ifficult executive won a few years at graduate school, gratis.) A company a=s smart as Enron could probably deduce too that dispatching one of the most= visible businesswomen in the country would provoke a public-relations disa=ster. So Lay and Skilling did something classically Enronian: They gave Mar=k her own company. Despite Skilling s contempt for asset-heavy businesses, =Enron spent more than $2 billion to buy a run-of-the-mill British water uti=lity that could serve as Enron s entry into the emerging world of water pri=vatization. Mark was put in charge of making Enron, yes, the world s greate=st water company. Azurix, as the new business was called, looked like anoth=er sure thing: Its IPO in 1999 raised $695 million.=20But Mark had to succeed on Enron s increasingly abbreviated timetable in a =business fraught with political and emotional complexities. Water is not li=ke gas or electricity-owners and governments are a lot less willing to give= it up, even for lots of money. The company stumbled, layoffs commenced, an=d confidence evaporated. By August 2000 the stock price, which had started =out at $19, had fallen to $5. Mark s resignation followed, and Azurix, much= diminished, was folded into Enron. ""I think it s best for Rebecca to start= afresh,"" Lay, who had been a mentor to Mark, told the Wall Street Journal.= Or as one critic put it, ""They were more interested in destroying the old =culture than running a business.""=20As 2000 drew to a close, Skilling was in total command. In December Ken Lay= announced the inevitable: ""The best time for the succession to occur is wh=en the company is doing well,"" he told the press. ""Enron is doing extremely= well now."" In February 2001 Jeff Skilling took over the CEO s job.ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THE TROUBLE STARTED. Enron s domination of the electric-=power market made it an instant target in the California deregulation debac=le. Both PBS s Frontline and the New York Times took on Enron, portraying t=he company as a heartless colossus that used its influence in Washington (L=ay and Enron s political action committee are the top contributors to Georg=e W. Bush) to force old people on fixed incomes to choose between buying fo=od or electricity. Skilling and Lay appeared on camera singing belligerent =anthems to the free market, while another memorable scene juxtaposed one of= the company s jackallike traders against a hapless state employee in Calif=ornia, as both tried to buy power online. The Times reported that Lay had t=ried to persuade a new federal commissioner to change his views on energy d=eregulation. The bad press was, to say the least, ironic: Just as the media= was pounding Enron for its omnipotence, Wall Street was discovering its we=aknesses. By late March the stock price had slid to $50 a share from $80 in= January.Within Enron, the asset-based divisions took the rap for the decline. (The =India plant continued to be enormously costly, at least in part because of =constant turnover within Enron s management team.) But the California situa=tion was more visible and therefore more damaging, despite Enron s claim th=at the state had never built enough power plants to service its population =and never properly managed those it had. ""For three months Gray Davis did a= very good job of blaming us,"" says Mark Palmer, a vice president for corpo=rate communications. ""We were a Texas company. There was a Texan in the Whi=te House. California was a state that didn t put him in office, and his big=gest contributor was a Texas energy company. Performance is going to take c=are of our stock price. The truth will take care of Gray Davis."" (Californi=a utilities still owe Enron $500 million, another reason stockholders might= be panicky.) But more problematic than the crisis itself was Skilling s al=l too apparent lack of contrition. Facing down his critics, he cracked a jo=ke comparing California with the Titanic. (""At least the Titanic went down =with its lights on."")But the biggest problem was Enron s telecommunications division, which had =been responsible for at least one third of its heady stock price. Investors= believed that Enron could revolutionize high-speed communications, just as= it had revolutionized gas and power. Enron estimated the global market for= buying and selling space over fiber-optic cable would grow from $155 billi=on in 2001 to $383 billion by 2004-but then the tech bubble burst. So too d=id the much-hyped movies-on-demand deal with Blockbuster. For the first tim=e in its confoundingly successful life, Enron had nothing new to take to ma=rket. Like the popular high school girl who suddenly packs on a few pounds,= Enron suddenly looked less alluring to Wall Street.Skilling launched a campaign to keep Enron s most important cheerleaders, t=he stock analysts, in the tent, but he wasn t cut out to be a supplicant. D=uring the reporting of first quarter profits, he called an analyst who chal=lenged Enron s financial reporting an ""asshole."" When the company reported =hefty second quarter profits, many analysts questioned whether those profit=s had come from the generation of new business or from the sale of old asse=ts. Ignoring the growing chorus critical of Enron s accounting, Skilling pr=omised, as he always had, that innovations were just around the corner. ""Th=ere wasn t any positive news,"" Carol Coale, of Prudential Financial, says n=ow. ""Basically, he talked me out of a downgrade.""The business press, so generous in the past, turned surly. Fortune had aske=d in March whether Enron was overpriced. (""Start with a pretty straightforw=ard question: How exactly does Enron make its money?"") The routine cashing =in of stock options that were about to expire by key executives was portray=ed in the media as a fire sale. (Skilling had sold $33 million worth, Ken L=ay and Ken Rice close to four times that amount.) Then the Wall Street Jour=nal reported on a fund run by the CFO that had been a source of strife with=in the company. (It was essentially risk management against Enron s possibl=e failures.) Every negative story seemed to produce a concurrent drop in th=e stock price: By late August it had fallen below $40. Enron, so institutio=nally unforgiving, finally got a taste of its own medicine. ""When Wall Stre=et is in love with a stock, they re forgiving of something like accounting,="" says Carol Coale. ""When a company falls out of favor, all these issues ca=rry more weight.""This fact was not lost on people inside the company, who suddenly started e=xperiencing an attack of conscience. Those who had looked the other way as =the most powerful Enron executives dumped their wives and married their sec=retaries or carried on flagrant interoffice affairs now saw the error of th=eir ways. ""It just created an attitude,"" one executive still at Enron says.= ""If senior people are doing that, why are we held to a higher standard? Th=ere was a real culture of  We re above everyone else. ""=20Loyalty had never been prized at Enron, so there was no reason to expect it= now. An old-fashioned, slow-moving company like Exxon could demand hardshi=p duty in Baku with the promise of greater rewards down the road. ""But,"" as= one Houston oilman explains, ""if you have to negotiate a hardship duty wit=h someone who doesn t have loyalty and has money, then you have a corporati=on that s better suited for good times than bad.""As it turned out, that description applied to Jeff Skilling too. As the sto=ck price stubbornly refused to ascend, he made no secret of his unhappiness= and frustration. Then, after a trip to visit the families of three employe=es killed at a plant in England, he had an epiphany: Life was short; for hi=m, Enron was over. Ever stoic, Ken Lay returned to the CEO s office, named =a new president, arranged a trip to New York to calm analysts and investors=, and promised a kinder, gentler Enron in the future. Trading anything and =everything was out. The company, Lay says, will still innovate but ""innovat=e much closer to our core."" As for the culture: ""Things like the Performanc=e Review Committee, I think we could have applied better. By trying to cate=gorize people into so many different categories, you ended up creating a mo=rale problem.""That Skilling s supposedly brilliant colleagues were as shocked at the news= of his departure as the rest of the business community may be testament to= their lack of emotional intelligence. Despite Skilling s lengthy tenure wi=th Enron, he d always been contemptuous of the long haul; he d always belie=ved in cutting losses and moving on. But now that he was abandoning them wh=en the company was in trouble, it was different. ""Even Jeff s biggest detra=ctors wouldn t have wanted him to walk out the door,"" one loyalist admits.But on the day we meet, Skilling is looking forward, not back. ""Look,"" he s=ays with finality, ""ninety percent of my net worth is in Enron. Were my int=erests aligned with the shareholders? Absolutely.""Free of falling stock prices and shareholder pressures, he is nestling hims=elf back into the world of ideas. His eyes flash as he talks about new tech=nologies. ""The first wave never gets it right,"" he says. ""The stand-alone d=ot-coms didn t work, but the technological applications will create a secon=d wave that will change the world."" Houston, he promises, will become the w=orld s center of commodity trading, and he intends to be a part of it. In f=act, he is already shopping for office space.""This is the second wave, and Enron s got it,"" he says, almost breathless. =""There are thousands of people running around the streets of Houston that g=et it."""

It s an excerpt from an analyst s noteout this AM.A Perspective: R.I.P. Enron:It took sixteen years to build Enron into a $63 billion asset powerhouse,but only 24 days for it to disintegrate.The fatal flaw was the aggressive accounting and leveraging done in variousoff balance sheet partnerships (Special Purpose Entities), which apparentlybecame too aggressive to fully disclose. Wall Street had no idea of their holdings,their leverage or their derivative exposures. The SPEs mutated intosomething beyond the pale, becoming a company within a company. This evidently began30 months ago when the new management regime (Skilling, Fastow, et al)sanctioned their evolution. Make no mistake: they were cleverly contrived. Theyinvolved conventional asset & debt transfers off the books, coupled with fair value(asset mark-to-market) accounting and synthetic equity financing. Thisallowed for considerable earnings management and the appearance of cost-free equity.If nothing else, they now appear in hindsight to have been vanity deals: veryNew Economy, very Virtual and very aggressive. But no clients ever complained,to our knowledge. Yet ENE clearly crossed the GAAP reporting lines, as thelatest 8-K attests, and the dual role of the CFO (sitting on both sides of thetable in the LJM transactions), profiting highly in the process, created in the LJMpartnership natural conflicts of interest now being investigated by the SEC.Because of this elementary mistake in any seasoned judgment, which passedmuster at every level, the most successful energy company of the 90s was vaporizedin the marketplace. The main thing that brought ENE down was hubris. It hadused up all of its credibility when the partnerships were brought to light. If thesewere fully revealed two years ago, a collapse would have been very unlikely.Rob LloydAIM Management713-214-4355"

I wanted to visit with you about the needs that you see for the Estate and the role that I might play.  I am focused currently on aiding in the due diligence work around the formation of Netco (from an operations perspective), although I am not on the list to go with Netco.  I am also working with Jim Fallon on supporting the business plans for the remaining wholesale  businesses within Enron.  Greg PIper and I also still share the OOC responsibilities for Enron Net Works as well. I am committed to Enron, but would appreciate a frank discussion about the timeline you see for me at Enron.  I need to have a job, and want to be appropriately prepared if the timeframe for me at Enron is limited.  Thanks.  --Sally"

But in the wake of post-agree=ment disclosures by Enron that its future earnings are likely to be substan=tially less than expected, the company s stock has been hammered. In 1 p.m.= trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday, Enron shares fell 30 cen=ts to $4.71. The stock is down 94% so far this year and far short of the pe=r-share takeover price. Dynegy shares rose 64 cents to $40.40.Although Dynegy and Enron both say they are going ahead with the deal under= the terms negotiated, Dynegy does appear to have other options. The agreem=ent with Enron contains a broad ""material adverse change"" clause as well as= some specific trigger points that could be invoked.=20Dynegy officials performed ""due diligence"" throughout the holiday weekend, =seeking to learn more about the intimate workings of Enron, which has suffe=red a series of damaging blows. Since mid-October, Enron has disclosed that= some of its officers participated in personally enriching deals that moved= assets off Enron s balance sheet, for a time, to several private partnersh=ips. Those deals are now the subject of a Securities and Exchange Commissio=n investigation. Past treatment of some of those deals has been termed an ""=accounting error"" by Enron and it twice has rejiggered its earnings since O=ct. 16. At one point, Enron restated downwards nearly five years of earning=s.=20An Enron spokeswoman said the company was proceeding in the belief that the= deal would be completed as agreed. Dynegy spokesman John Sousa said the tw=o sides are forging ahead although he acknowledged that the walk-away provi=sions ""are broad, by design, to ensure adequate protection for Dynegy share=holders."" Shareholders of both firms must still vote on the merger agreemen=t.=20Clauses related to a ""material adverse change,"" also known as a ""material a=dverse effect,"" have been the focus of much attention among merger professi=onals this year, due, in part, to the stock market s fluctuations and the e=conomic slowdown that have caused some buyers to reconsider planned acquisi=tions.=20But such clauses rarely are invoked by a buyer or seller because they are c=onsidered extremely difficult to prove. Both parties typically are reluctan=t to lay out specific terms for canceling a deal, much the way a bride and =groom often balk at negotiating a prenuptial agreement since it appears to =envisage a breakup of the marriage even before it begins.=20Furthermore, a key court case earlier this year affirmed widespread views t=hat a buyer can t easily walk away from a merger. In that case, meat-proces=sing concern Tyson Foods Inc. sought to cancel a planned acquisition of mea=t-packer IBP Inc. due to a drop in IBP s earnings and a write-down of an IB=P subsidiary. But a Delaware judge refused to let Tyson cancel the pact, sa=ying Tyson had been aware of the cyclical nature of IBP s business and the =accounting issue.=20In a lengthy June 18 opinion, Delaware Chancery Court Vice Chancellor Leo E=. Strine Jr. wrote that "" . . . the important thing is whether the company =has suffered a Material Adverse Effect in its business or results of operat=ions that is consequential to the company s earnings power over a commercia=lly reasonable period, which one would think would be measured in years rat=her than months.""=20That interpretation has created ripples in the deal-making community, promp=ting some transactions to include more details about circumstances under wh=ich deals can be terminated. Since the Sept. 11 attacks, for example, a han=dful of merger agreements have specified that future terrorist activity wou=ld qualify as a ""material adverse change,"" or MAC.=20A key issue for any firm alleging there has been a material adverse change =is ""whether the new facts go to the guts of the strategic opportunity or is= it just a hiccup,"" says Meredith Brown, co-chairman of the mergers and acq=uisitions group at law firm Debevoise & Plimpton in New York. He adds that =a court ""may be skeptical"" if Dynegy claimed that Enron s post-merger agree=ment disclosures were a surprise.=20The Enron-Dynegy merger agreement includes several triggers permitting eith=er side to seek termination. Enron can quit the deal if it receives a subst=antially better offer, although it is prohibited from soliciting one. In su=ch a case, it could be required to pay a $350 million ""topper fee"" to Dyneg=y and its co-investor, ChevronTexaco Inc.=20Dynegy can alter the deal if Enron faces ""pending or threatened"" litigation= liabilities that are ""reasonably likely"" to cost Enron $2 billion. If thos=e liabilities hit $3.5 billion ""an Enron material event will be deemed to h=ave occurred,"" presumably allowing Dynegy to call the whole thing off. In s=ome situations, Dynegy would be liable for a $350 million fee, as well.=20Karen Denne, the Enron spokeswoman, said her firm doesn t believe that loss=es arising from the normal course of business would qualify as a material e=vent. The liability must result from litigation. Currently, the company fac=es more than a dozen shareholder suits alleging breach of fiduciary duty by= officers and directors, issuing false and misleading reports and other off=enses.=20Deal makers who aren t involved in the combination say the steep drop in En=ron s stock price since the merger agreement was signed wouldn t by itself =give Dynegy the ability to cancel the pact or force Enron to renegotiate it=s terms. Instead, they say, Dynegy would likely have to prove that Enron s =worsening financial condition was an unanticipated event, which could be di=fficult in light of the company s highly publicized problems and Dynegy s f=requent statement that it clearly understands Enron s businesses. Still, th=ere is another standard clause in the merger document that would allow Dyne=gy to terminate the deal if ""any representation or warranty of Enron shall =have become untrue.""=20Other energy companies have abandoned deals following a widening gap in sto=ck prices that changed an acquisition premium. Western Resources Inc. of To=peka, Kansas last week sued Public Service Co. of New Mexico seeking hundre=ds of millions of dollars in damages after it failed to buy Western s utili=ties. The lawsuit accused Public Service of breaching its ""duty of good fai=th and fair dealing"" and said the New Mexico company tried to ""sabotage"" th=e deal as the two companies  stock prices diverged.

All Rights Reserved. =09The Corporation: AcquisitionsThe Other Instant Powerhouse in Energy TradingBy Louise Lee in San Mateo, Calif.11/26/2001BusinessWeek96(Copyright 2001 McGraw-Hill, Inc.)It s not easy being No. 4. Despite a $35 billion merger completed in Octobe=r, ChevronTexaco Corp. is still not one of the oil superpowers. Nor, at mor=e than $90 billion a year in revenues, is it a scrappy little guy. So Chair=man David J. O Reilly has been searching for a strategy beyond just drillin=g for more oil and gas.=20Now, he may have something: a big stake in the No. 1 energy-trading company=. Chevron Corp. has owned 26% of Dynegy Inc. since 1996, and with Dynegy s =planned acquisition of Enron Corp., the top energy trader, ChevronTexaco is= making the oil industry s most aggressive push yet into this fast-growing =business. It plans to eventually pump $2.5 billion into the combined Dynegy= and Enron to maintain its 26% stake, and it might raise that share. So, wh=ile ChevronTexaco s much bigger rivals run small in-house trading operation=s, energy trading may soon account for more than 10% of ChevronTexaco s ear=nings. ``Chevron is now positioned to be a leader in the business,   says a=nalyst Arjun Murti at Goldman, Sachs & Co.The deal would certainly dovetail with ChevronTexaco s strategy of becoming= a more integrated energy company, with a hand in everything from pumping o=il at the wellhead to trading natural-gas futures. By acquiring Texaco, Che=vron picked up, for instance, a big refining-and-marketing business --which= should balance out the bad times in oil and gas production, says Eugene No=wak, an analyst at ABN Amro. ``When crude-oil prices are down, they ll have= margin improvements on refining and marketing,   he says. O Reilly and oth=er ChevronTexaco executives declined to comment.=20Until now, Dynegy wasn t a big deal for Chevron. Chevron purchased the stak=e for $700 million when Dynegy was still called NGC Corp., and it filled th=ree of the 14 board seats--positions it will keep. Since then, Chevron has =sold nearly all its domestic natural-gas production to Dynegy. The stake ha=s been a good investment: it is now worth $3 billion, ChevronTexaco says.==20Sitting on $2.9 billion in cash as of the end of the second quarter, Chevro=nTexaco can well afford the Dynegy deal, analysts say. And they expect O Re=illy to use some of that to make more buys; the most likely target is a nat=ural-gas company. Maybe it s not so bad being No. 4.Illustration: Chart: CHEVRON S GROWING CASH HOARD=20Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

CEO Charles L. Watson if he had sat= back and gloated. After all, Watson had watched as his bigger, brasher cro=sstown rival sniffed at Dynegy s more cautious strategy, all the while garn=ering most of the credit for reshaping the energy-trading business.=20Instead, Watson picked up the phone on Oct. 24 and called Enron Chairman, C=EO, and longtime acquaintance Kenneth L. Lay to ask how he could help. Lay =didn t respond immediately, but as Enron s stock continued to plunge and th=e company faced a cash squeeze, it became clear what the only realistic ans=wer could be: Bail us out.So two days later, Lay invited Watson to his River Oaks home near downtown =Houston for breakfast to discuss a deal. Over muffins and ``a bad cup of co=ffee   the next day, Watson recalls, they sketched the outlines, and by 10 =p.m. that night, the investment bankers were called in. On Nov. 9, Dynegy a=nnounced that it would pay about $10 billion, plus the assumption of $13 bi=llion in debt, to buy Enron, which is nearly four times its size. The key t=o the deal was Dynegy s immediate $1.5 billion infusion of cash to shore up= Enron s balance sheet and save its credit rating. The money came from Dyne=gy s 26% owner, ChevronTexaco Corp.=20Without that help, Enron--the seventh-largest U.S. company, based on its $1=00 billion in sales last year--may well have faced bankruptcy. Watson says =that he never would have imagined such an outcome in his wildest dreams. ``=I don t think anybody foresaw the problems [at Enron],   he says. ``It s be=en incredible to watch.  =20Watson, 51, has to make good on what may well be his riskiest investment ye=t. If he can pull it off, the new Dynegy will have revenues of more than $2=00 billion and $90 billion in assets, including more than 22,000 megawatts =of power-generating capacity and 25,000 miles of pipeline. It would control= an estimated 20% to 25% of the energy-trading market, up from about 6% now=.=20That would be sweet vindication for Watson s strategy. Dynegy backs trading= operations with hard assets such as power plants, which allows the company= to guarantee a supply of electricity to a buyer. In contrast, Enron has wo=rked furiously to shed power plants and oil- and gas-generating fields, bel=ieving it could earn higher returns using its trading and technology expert=ise to tap assets owned by others in markets including steel, pulp, and pap=er. IRRESISTIBLE BARGAIN. As Enron s stock slid below $9 from its August, 2=000, high of $90, it became a bargain that Watson couldn t pass up.

Here s what companies should do-=-and what investors need to knowBy Nanette Byrnes and David Henry=20With Mike McNamee in Washington11/26/2001BusinessWeek76(Copyright 2001 McGraw-Hill, Inc.)In an age when giant earnings write-offs have become commonplace, it s hard= to shock Wall Street. But on Nov. 8, Enron Corp. managed to do it. After y=ears of high-octane growth that had seen earnings surge by up to 24% a year=, the Houston-based energy company acknowledged that results for the past t=hree years were actually overstated by more than a half-billion dollars. It= was confirmation of investors  worst fears. Three weeks earlier, Enron had= announced a big drop in shareholders  equity, sparking fears that its hide=ously complex financial statements were distorting its true performance. Ma=nagement pointed to a number of factors, including a dubious decision to ex=clude the results of three partnerships from its financial statements and a= billion-dollar error several years earlier that had inflated the company s= net worth.=20Enron may be an extreme example of a company whose performance fell far sho=rt of the glowing picture painted by management in its earnings releases, b=ut it is hardly alone. This year, Corporate America is expected to charge o=ff a record $125 billion, much of it for assets, investments, and inventory= that aren t worth as much as management thought (chart, page 79). Even if =companies don t go back and restate earnings, as Enron is doing, those char=ges cast doubt on the record-breaking earnings growth of the late  90s.Not since the 1930s has the quality of corporate earnings been such an issu=e--and so difficult for investors to determine. There s more at stake than =the fortunes of those who bought shares based on misleading numbers. If eve=n the most sophisticated financial minds can t figure out what a company ac=tually earns, that has implications far beyond Enron. U.S. financial market=s have a reputation for integrity that took decades to build. It has made t=he U.S. the gold standard for financial reporting and the preeminent place =to invest. It has also ensured ready access to capital for U.S. corporation=s. That a company such as Enron, a member of the Standard & Poor s 500-stoc=k index and one of the largest companies on the New York Stock Exchange, co=uld fall so far so fast shows how badly that gold standard has been tarnish=ed. ``The profession of auditing and accounting is, in fact, in crisis,   s=ays Paul A. Volcker, former chairman of the Federal Reserve and now one of =the leaders of the International Accounting Standards Board.=20Sometimes, as in the case of Enron, fuzzy numbers result from questionable =decisions in figuring net earnings. More often, though, the earnings chaos =results from a disturbing trend among companies to calculate profits in the=ir own idiosyncratic ways--and an increasing willingness among investors an=d analysts to accept those nonstandard tallies, which appear under a variet=y of names, from ``pro forma   to ``core.   (Enron offers its own such vers=ion. Before investors untangled the importance of Enron s first announcemen=t, its stock rose briefly because it told investors that its ``recurring ne=t income   had met expectations.) The resulting murk makes it difficult to =answer the most basic question in investing: What did my company earn?=20Why calculate a second set of earnings in the first place? Because the numb=ers reached by applying generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) are= woefully inadequate when it comes to giving investors a good sense of a co=mpany s prospects. Many institutional investors, most Wall Street analysts,= and even many accountants say GAAP is irrelevant. ``I don t know anyone wh=o uses GAAP net income anymore for anything,   says Lehman Brothers Inc. ac=counting expert Robert Willens. The problem is that GAAP includes a lot of =noncash charges and one-time expenses. While investors need to be aware of =those charges, they also need a number that pertains solely to the performa=nce of ongoing operations.=20That s what operating earnings are supposed to do. But because they re calc=ulated in an ad hoc manner, with each company free to use its own rules, co=mparisons between companies have become meaningless. ``No investor--certain=ly not any ordinary investor--can read these in a way that s useful,   says= Harvey L. Pitt, chairman of the Securities & Exchange Commission. The SEC =is examining whether new rules are needed to clarify financial reports and =perhaps restrict use of pro formas.=20What s badly needed is a set of rules for calculating operating earnings an=d a requirement to make clear how they relate to net income. In the end, in=vestors need two numbers--a standardized operating number and an audited ne=t-income number--and a clear explanation of how to get from one to the othe=r. ``OUT OF HAND.   A widespread consensus is building to do just that. In =early November, S&P proposed a set of rules for companies to follow when ta=llying operating earnings. Only the week before, the Financial Accounting S=tandards Board, the rulemakers for GAAP, had announced that they, too, woul=d be taking up this issue. Volcker says the International Accounting Standa=rds Board is also seeking a uniform definition of operating earnings.=20``Over the past two or three years, the use of creative earnings measures h=as grown and grown and grown to the point where it has really gotten out of= hand,   says David M. Blitzer, S&P s chief investment strategist. ``Earnin=gs are one of the key measures that anybody looks at when they re trying to= evaluate a company. If people want to use an operating-earnings measure, w=e better all know what we re looking at.  =20Without those standards in place, the gap between earnings according to gen=erally accepted accounting principles and earnings according to Wall Street= is only going to grow wider and more confusing. Look at the variance in ea=rnings per share calculated for the S&P 500 for the third quarter: It s $10=.78 according to Wall Street analysts as tallied by Thomson Financial/First= Call, $9.17 according to S&P, and $6.37 according to numbers reported to t=he SEC under GAAP. (S&P, like BusinessWeek, is owned by The McGraw-Hill Com=panies.)=20The lack of a standard measure can be costly to those who choose wrong. Use= First Call s earnings for the past four quarters and you get a relatively =modest price-earnings ratio of 23 for the S&P 500. But run the numbers usin=g GAAP earnings, and suddenly the market has a far steeper p-e of 38.=20How did we get into this mess? Investors and analysts have been calculating= operating earnings for years, and for years, reasonable people could more =or less agree on how to do it. Then came the dot-com bubble, along with inc=reased pressure from Wall Street for companies to meet their quarterly earn=ings forecasts. Suddenly, companies that hadn t turned a profit by any conv=entional measure started offering ever more inventive earnings variants. Th=ese customized pro forma calculations excluded a grab bag of expenses and a=llowed upstart companies to show a profit. ``TOWER OF BABEL.   Pro forma fo=rmulas vary wildly from company to company and even from quarter to quarter= within the same company, casting doubt on their validity. And these days, =the gulf between net earnings and pro forma earnings is wider than ever. S&=P s tallies fall between the two: S&P s numbers are more systematic than pr=o forma, but they aren t followed widely enough to be a standard. ``Investo=rs are facing a Tower of Babel,   says Robert K. Elliott, former chief of t=he American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) and a retired= KPMG partner. ``It s not standardized, and the numbers are not audited.  ==20That makes it tough to evaluate a company s performance. In the quarter end=ed on Sept. 30, Nortel Networks Corp. offered shareholders at least three e=arnings numbers to choose from. By conservative GAAP accounting, the teleco=mmunications giant lost $1.08 a share. The company also provided two possib=le pro forma options: a 68 cents loss that excluded ``special charges,   in=cluding some acquisition costs and restructuring charges, and a still bette=r 27 cents loss that further excluded $1.9 billion of ``incremental charges=,   such as writing down inventories and increasing provisions for receivab=les. Wall Street chose the rosiest one.=20Confusing? You bet. Companies defend their pro forma calculations by pointi=ng out that they re merely filling a void: Investors are clamoring for a me=asure that gives them better insight into their company s future. The goal =is to get to the core of the business and try to measure the outlook for th=ose operations. ``There are good reasons why there is an emphasis on operat=ing earnings,   says Volcker. ``It is an effort to provide some continuity =and some reflection of the underlying progress of the company.   Besides, a=s companies like to point out, they still have to report GAAP earnings, and= investors are free to ignore everything else.=20There s no starker lesson in the shortcomings of GAAP than the $50 billion =asset write-downs by JDS Uniphase Corp., the biggest charge of the year. Ne=ar the height of the telecom bull market in July, 2000, the San Jose (Calif=.) maker of fiber optics topped off a buying spree by acquiring competitor =SDL Inc. for $41 billion in stock. When the deal closed in February, its as=sets ballooned from $25 billion to $65 billion. But by then, shares of JDS =and other fiber-optics makers were collapsing. To bring its acquisitions in=to line with their new value, the company took charges of $50 billion. Desp=ite the fact that the bulk of its losses stemmed from stock transactions an=d involved no cash paid, GAAP required that the charges be taken out of net= income. So according to GAAP, JDS lost $56 billion in the fiscal year endi=ng in June--a staggering figure for a company whose revenues over the past =five years added up to only $5 billion.=20Analysts and the company argue that besides not involving cash, the charge-=off was all about the past, a right-sizing of values that had gotten out of= hand. To analyze the company s prospects, they excluded the $50 billion ch=arge. ``The accounting is not designed to make things look better but to de=scribe what happened,   says JDS Uniphase Chief Financial Officer Anthony R=. Muller, ``and we ll live with the consequences, whatever they are.   Anal=ysts make a similar defense. ``My goal is to figure out what the business i=s going to produce so that we can value the company,   says Lehman Brothers= analyst Arnab Chanda. GLACIAL PACE. Are JDS s pro forma numbers realistic-=-a fair gauge of JDS s ongoing operations? Right now, it s hard for investo=rs to judge. And that s the kind of ambiguity S&P and others would like to =eliminate. In November, S&P circulated a memo on how to standardize operati=ng earnings. Under the proposal, operating earnings would include the costs= of purchases, research and development, restructuring costs (including sev=erance), write-downs from ongoing operations, and the cost to the company o=f stock options. It would exclude merger-and-acquisition expenses, impairme=nt of goodwill, litigation settlements, and the gain or loss on the sale of= an asset.=20When S&P applied roughly that formula to JDS Uniphase, it split the differe=nce between Wall Street and GAAP. Because of differences in what each group= included in their earnings calculations, the results were chaotic. Using G=AAP, the company lost $9.39 a share. S&P figures it lost $3.19, while the c=ompany put the loss at 36 cents. Meanwhile, Wall Street says it made 2 cent=s.=20The S&P standard may make sense, but it raises the question: Where is the F=inancial Accounting Standards Board, the group in charge of GAAP? Chairman =Edmund L. Jenkins says FASB will be addressing the problems. Still, investo=rs shouldn t expect any improvement soon. The pace of change at FASB tends =to be glacial. It typically takes four years to complete a new standard. In= 1996, for example, the board realized that standards on restructuring char=ges had some big loopholes and it resolved to put the issue on its agenda. =In June, 2000, the board finally issued a draft of a new standard, asked fo=r comments, and held a public hearing. In October, 2001, the board said it =still wasn t ready to put a fix in place. Now, the recession has set off an=other wave of restructuring charges, and the FASB still doesn t have new ru=les.=20The slow pace means the standard-setters sometimes fail to react to sudden =changes in the market. The most recent failure followed the terrorist attac=ks on September 11. An FASB task force, unable to come up with a set of rul=es for separating September 11 costs from general expenses, instead told co=mpanies that the disaster could not be treated as an extraordinary item. So= GAAP earnings include costs stemming from the disaster as part of a compan=y s general performance. Many companies have nevertheless broken those cost=s out in their unaudited press releases.=20Many more are likely to do so in the fourth quarter. Indeed, 2001 is shapin=g up to be one for the record books. A poor economy and the devastating aft=ereffects of September 11 have resulted in a slew of unusual charges that a=re unlikely to recur and that no one could have foreseen. But there s a gro=wing concern that the earnings fog is providing managers with cover to hide= missteps of the past within that vast category of supposedly one-time char=ges. The temptation will be to take as big a charge as possible now, while =investors are braced for bad news. Not only can managers sweep away yesterd=ay s errors, but tomorrow s earnings will look even better.=20The basic question comes down to what constitutes a special expense--a char=ge so unusual that to include it in the earnings calculation would be to di=stort the truth about a company s performance. Usually, big charges fall in=to a few categories, including charges for laying off workers and restructu=ring a company, charges for assets that have lost value since they were pur=chased, charges for investments that have lost value, and charges for inven=tory that has become obsolete. In a recent study, Harvard Business School p=rofessor Mark T. Bradshaw found that companies are increasingly calling the=se charges unusual. That gives them a rationale for excluding them from the=ir pro forma calculations.=20Lots of critics disagree, saying such charges are often an inevitable part =of the business cycle and should be reflected in a company s earnings histo=ry. They certainly should not be ignored by investors. ``Charges are real s=hareholder wealth that s been lost,   argues David W. Tice, manager of the =Prudent Bear Fund, a mutual fund with a pessimistic bent that s up 17% so f=ar this year. ``It s money they spent on something no longer worth what it =was, a correction of past earnings, or a reserve for costs moving forward. =Whatever the reason, it s a real cost to the company, and that hurts shareh=olders.   Without standards, excessive write-offs from operating earnings c=an obscure actual performance. Without any rules, companies calculate opera=ting earnings inconsistently in order to put their companies in the best po=ssible light. Dell Computer Corp. is a good example of this ``heads I win, =tails you lose   school of accounting. For years, Dell benefited from gains= in its venture-capital investments and was happy to include those gains in= its reported earnings, where they appeared as a separate line on the incom=e statement. But this year, when those gains turned to losses, the computer= maker issued pro forma numbers that excluded that $260 million drag. Dell =spokesman Michael Maher says the company s press releases and SEC filings b=reak out investment income and give GAAP numbers as well as pro forma. ``In= our view, the numbers are reported clearly,   says Maher. ``It s all out t=here for the consuming public.   PAST PUFFERY. Many experts believe special= charges are a sign that past performance was exaggerated. What should inve=stors make of a company such as Gateway Inc.? Two restructuring charges in =the first and third quarters, minus a small extraordinary gain, totaled $1.=12 billion, or about $100 million more than the company made in 1998, 1999,= and 2000 combined. Which is the truer picture of its performance and poten=tial? The write-offs or the earnings? Write-offs for customer financing are= another example. When Nortel increased its reserves for credit extended to= customers by $767 million in September, it effectively admitted it had boo=ked sales in the past to companies that couldn t pay--in effect overstating= its performance in those earlier periods. In addition, Nortel says booking= sales and accounting for credit are unrelated issues. Tech companies blame= the sharp downturn in their industry for the big write-offs. And these are=n t isolated examples. Peter L. Bernstein, publisher of newsletter Economic=s & Portfolio Strategy, found that from 1989 to 1993, 20% of earnings vanis=hed into write-offs.=20Big charge-offs can also distort future performance. Critics contend that e=xcess reserves are often used as a sort of ``cookie jar   from which earnin=gs can be taken in future quarters to meet Wall Street s expectations. Or c=harges taken this year, for example, which is apt to be a lousy one for mos=t companies anyway, might include costs that would otherwise have been take=n in future periods. Prepaying those costs gives a big boost to later earni=ngs. Rules for figuring operating earnings would help, but this is an area =that will always involve a certain amount of judgment--and therefore invite= a certain amount of abuse. ``People are going to write off everything they= can in the next two quarters because they re having a bad year anyway,   s=ays Robert G. Atkins, a Mercer Management consultant.=20Part of the lure of big special charges is that investors tend to shrug the=m off, believing that with the bad news out in the open, the company is poi=sed for a brighter future. Since Gateway detailed its third-quarter charge =of $571 million on Oct. 18, Wall Street has bid the stock up 48%, compared =with a 6% runup for the S&P 500.=20Often, though, investors should take exactly the opposite message. If, for =example, part of a restructuring involves slashing employee training, infor=mation-technology spending, or research and development, the cuts could dep=ress future performance, says Baruch Lev, a professor of accounting at the =Stern School of Business at New York University. ``Are these really one-tim=e events?   he asks. ``Or is this the beginning of an avalanche?   Indeed, =Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co. strategist Steve Galbraith has found that =in the year following a big charge-off to earnings companies have underperf=ormed the stock market by 20 percentage points. ``LA LA LAND.   Investors a=re apt to be faced with more huge write-offs next year, even if the economy= doesn t continue to worsen. Why? The transition to a new GAAP rule that ch=anges the way companies account for goodwill--a balance-sheet asset that re=flects the amount paid for an acquisition over the net value of the tangibl=e assets. Under the new rule, companies will have to assess their propertie=s periodically and decrease their worth on the balance sheet if their value= falls. An informal survey by Financial Executives International of its mem=ber controllers and financial officers found that at least a third expect t=o take more charges.=20But figuring out the proper value of those assets is no easy task. Unless t=here is a comparable company or factory with an established market price, v=aluing them involves a lot of guesswork for which there are no firm rules. =``What this is really coming down to is corporations and their auditors com=ing up with their own tests for impairment,   says the Stern School s Profe=ssor Paul R. Brown. ``It s La La Land.  =20While the tidal wave of special charges is providing cover for earnings gam=es, it could also be an impetus for change--especially in the wake of the d=ot-com fiasco. Indeed, there are some signs of a backlash. The real estate =investment trust industry was a pioneer of engineered earnings, with its ``=funds from operations,   or FFO. But now some REITs have begun to revert to= plain old GAAP earnings. Hamid R. Moghadam, CEO of San Francisco-based AMB= Property Corp., shifted back to GAAP in 1999. ``The reason I don t like FF=O is very simple,   says Moghadam. ``One company s numbers look better than= another one s even if they had identical fundamental results.  =20There are other steps FASB could take to improve financial reporting and re=store GAAP s status. Trevor S. Harris, an accounting expert at Morgan Stanl=ey, says it could force companies to make clear distinctions between income= from operations and income from financial transactions. Lehman s Willens s=ays companies should provide more information on cash expenses and how they= bear on earnings. An easy step would be to require companies to file their= press releases with the SEC.=20At the least, says Lev, companies must clearly explain how their pro forma =numbers relate to the GAAP numbers. Otherwise, he says, investors ``see num=bers floating there, and where did they come from?   In today s environment= of unregulated pro forma calculations and supersize write-offs, no questio=n is more important to investors.High-Gloss GlossaryCompanies are using a variety of accounting practices to put the best spin =ontheir results. Here s what those terms mean:DEFINING EARNINGS:NET INCOMEThe bottom line, according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAA=P).Sometimes called ``reported earnings,   these are the numbers the Securitie=s &Exchange Commission accepts in its filings.OPERATING EARNINGSAn adjustment of net income that excludes certain costs deemed to be unrela=tedto the ongoing business. Although it sounds deceptively like a GAAP figurecalled ``operating income   (revenue minus the costs of doing business), it= isnot an audited figure.CORE EARNINGSAnother term for operating earnings. Neither core nor operating earnings ar=ecalculated according to set rules. They can include or exclude anything thepreparer wishes.PRO FORMA EARNINGSThe 1990s term for operating earnings. Popularized by dot-coms, it sometime=sexcludes such basic costs as marketing and interest.EBITDAEarnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. Thegranddaddy of pro forma, it was initially highlighted by industries thatcarried high debt loads, such as cable TV, but has since come to be widelyquoted.ADJUSTED EARNINGSA new term for pro forma.DEFINING COSTS:SPECIAL CHARGESA general term for anything a company wants to highlight as unusual andtherefore to be excluded from future earnings projections.ASSET IMPAIRMENTSCharges taken to bring something a company paid a high price for down to it=scurrent market value. Many companies are now taking these charges on intern=alventure-capital funds that bought Internet and other high-tech stocks atinflated prices.GOODWILL IMPAIRMENTSThe same idea as asset impairments except they re used to write down thepremium a company paid over the fair market value of the net tangible asset=sacquired. These charges will explode in the first quarter of 2002 because o=f achange in mergers-and-acquisitions accounting that eliminates goodwillamortization and requires holdings to be carried at no more than fair value=s.RESTRUCTURING RESERVESAn accrued expense (not usually cash) to cover future costs of closing down= aportion of a business, a plant, or of firings. These are projected costs an=dif overstated can later become a boost to earnings as they are reversed.WRITE-DOWNLowering the value of an asset, such as a plant or stock investment. It isoften excused as a bookkeeping exercise, but there may have been a real cos=tlong ago that now proves ill spent, or there may have been associated cashcosts, such as investment-banking fees.Illustration: Chart: THE BIG BATH CHART BY ERIC HOFFMANN/BW=20Illustration: Chart: EARNINGS CHAOS CHART BY ERIC HOFFMANN/BW=20Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The equity culture that has generated so much growth over the year=s depends on a clear answer, but getting one has become impossible. Enron C=orp. just announced that its earnings for the past three years were oversta=ted by half a billion dollars. How did one of the biggest companies on the =New York Stock Exchange manage to inflate its earnings by 20% without audit=ors, analysts, ratings agencies, and the business press (BusinessWeek inclu=ded) discovering it? In part, blame the breakdown of standardized accountin=g rules and the anarchy that runs rampant in the financial statements of Co=rporate America. The U.S. needs a new set of accounting rules that gives a =clear picture of financial performance. Without integrity in financial repo=rting, the U.S. cannot hope to remain the preeminent place to invest in the= global marketplace (page 76).=20The dot-com bubble was the first indication that there was something seriou=sly wrong with accounting standards. Companies without much of a business m=odel customized their quarterly statements to exclude a grab bag of expense=s in order to put a positive financial spin on their operations. Wall Stree=t conspired in this and encouraged big companies to join in. Soon, the meth=od of calculating earnings began to vary from company to company and even f=rom quarter to quarter within a company. It is now chaos.A stricter adherence to accounting rules won t solve the entire problem. GA=AP, the generally accepted accounting principles, allow all kinds of one-ti=me expenses and noncash charges. This obscures the performance of ongoing o=perations. No one can fathom what are true operating earnings because there= are no guidelines as to what constitutes an extraordinary expense. The res=ult is total confusion. Take earnings per share for the Standard & Poor s 5=00-stock index for the second quarter. Under Thomson Financial/First Call s=tandards, it is $11.82. But it s $9.02 according to S&P and $4.83 under GAA=P. How can investors make intelligent decisions?=20The Financial Accounting Standards Board clearly is failing to do its job. =It has promised to write a set of rules that calculates operating earnings =and relates them to net earnings, but it hasn t delivered. The rating agenc=y Standard & Poor s (owned by The McGraw-Hill Companies, as is BusinessWeek=) is doing a better job. It recently drew up a definition of ``operating ea=rnings   that includes restructuring costs (including severance), writedown=s from ongoing operations, and the cost of stock options. It excludes merge=r and acquisition expenses, litigation settlements, impairment of goodwill,= and gains or losses on asset sales. This is a beginning that FASB should b=uild on.

But the stock market, after an initial selloff, has= shown remarkable resilience.=20Few observers expect stock-market volatility to subside soon. Still, expert=s say that now, more than ever, is the time for skittish investors to keep =their wits about them.In a recent interview, Charles R. Schwab, chairman and co-chief executive o=f Charles Schwab & Co., the San Francisco-based online and discount brokera=ge firm, gave his views on what investors should be doing -- and what mista=kes they should avoid.=20Here are some excerpts from the interview:=20In the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks, how much more risk, if any, do you thi=nk is in the financial markets? Or do you think it s just that people s per=ceptions about risk have changed?=20I ve been investing since 1959, and I have to say that, year after year, th=e risk hasn t changed. The risk is always there. There s risk in investing =in stocks, bonds and even U.S. Treasuries because of interest-rate [fluctua=tions]. There s risk in real estate, too.=20So the question is: How do you handle it? The best way is to diversify. Ove=r a long period of time, people who diversify their investments do pretty d=arned well. When they don t . . . sometimes it s fatal. If the only stock a=n investor owned was Enron . . . or Cisco at 70, that was pretty fatal.=20What do you say to people who say they re too scared to invest right now? T=hat because of the threat of terrorism, the anthrax scares, the war in Afgh=anistan, the recession, and so forth, there s just too much uncertainty in =the markets?=20I remember back during the Cuban missile crisis, we all feared the worst. W=e were all building bomb shelters. It was a scary time. This terrorist thin=g is no different. It s awful -- particularly for our children. But this co=untry is so wealthy, in terms of its resources, intellectual capital and th=e strength of our government.=20There is no more uncertainty today than in times past. For example, we ve h=ad many recessions. It s not fun, especially when you begin reading about a=ll these layoffs. In fact, I think the unemployment rate [now at 5.4%] pret=ty easily might get to 6.5% before it gets better. And it probably won t ge=t better until March or April. Also, the stock market will go up, hopefully= before the economy goes up.=20There s $2 trillion sitting in money-market accounts. That s a huge resourc=e and buying power that s definitely available for new investments.=20What do you think is the biggest mistake investors have made over the past =two or so months?=20They let their emotions take over. With the fear that people had, they didn= t use their rational thinking. They used their emotional thinking. [After =Sept. 11], they sold at the low, and fear was the driver.=20Just a year and a half ago, the driving emotion was greed. You re not going= to avoid this stuff. So the issue is how you manage through these cycles o=f fear and greed. Even when I m fearful of something, I say to myself: ""Thi=s is still the time to invest.""=20My biggest worry right now is that people will give up and say, ""I just don= t want to be in the stock market at all."" And it s just the time that peop=le should be hanging on and keeping a diversified portfolio.=20Some other mistakes: A lot of people hang on to the stock that was the post=er child of the last cycle. Or people say, ""I ll get back in [the market] w=hen I see the economy turn around."" Well, by the time they see that, it s t=oo late. They will have missed the whole ride back up.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Dynegy= Chief Executive Chuck Watson said he was ""encouraged"" by the commitment to= extend the note payment as well as the closing of a $450-million credit fa=cility.

377963,2001-12-14 12:08:12,"Here is the document I mentioned that Lance Schuler is working on in NYC.  It may be presented already by the time you read this and I was only brought in to it late yesterday.  I think Louise might also be adding some changes as well.Basically, it does have the estate assigning all Intellectual Property rights for software (EOL and other gas and power systems I assume) over to NetCo and has the estate take back an object code and source code license with full development rights in perpetuity that we can use for anything we want.  The one thing it restricts is our ability to sub license to a 3rd party in NA gas and power trading.If NetCo fails or folds, we get all the assets back.It also allows for a 60 day redirect so when NetCo gets their site up, (but not longer than 90 days after closing of agreement), if people type in EnronOnline.com, they will end up at NetCoOnline and that site will have a link back to EnronOnline.  After that time period, EnronOnline will only provide a link to NetCoOnline for another 120 days (Louise wants 250 days) and vica versa.  I asked that the location of the banner and link be mutually acceptable.As long as we hold more than 20% of NetCo, they won t assign or license to a 3rd party or use it in certain commodities (non gas and power I assume).  NetCo can license it to affiliates so whatever bank buys them if they are an affiliate, they can all us it for trading things other than what we put on that restricted list, which is bracketed and empty in my version.There is no reference as to whether the estate can trade gas and power in North America but it does not preclude us from using the software to do so.Lot s of other stuff (we let them borrow the EnronOnline trademark for 6 months to market their site but they can use it only for the sole purpose of marketing wholesale gas and power trading in NA and they can t disparage our name).As I said at the start, I am far from the person controlling this particular part of the entire deal but I did what I could to help the estate in this agreement.Greg Piper-----Original Message-----From: Roger.Ross@weil.com [mailto:Roger.Ross@weil.com]Sent: Friday, December 14, 2001 12:45 PMTo: mary.korby@weil.com; stephen.kahn@weil.com; marita.makinen@weil.com;stuart.ogg@weil.com; nancy.raber@weil.com; john.quattrocchi@weil.com;roberto.zapata@weil.com; michael.farnell@weil.com; Schuler, Lance(Legal); Daniels, Eddy; Koehler, Anne C.; Hansen, Leslie; Piper, Greg;Detmering, Tim; gabriel.matus@weil.comSubject: Revised Draft of the Assignment and License AgreementHere is the latest draft for review.

377994,2001-12-20 13:51:45,"FYI belowBy the end of tomorrow, all remaining employees in wholesale will be told which list they are on, NetCo or Estate, and be given info and talking points.Here is the estate ones.  I will forward the NetCo ones later.Since the NetCo people s names could and probably will be exposed to bidders in the date rooms, they all need to decide quickly if they want to stay on that list or not.  Eventually, like end of December or very, very early January, if they have not pulled their name off the NetCo list, they will have to accept an offer from the winning bidder or quit because they won t have an opportunity back to the estate.This is all uncomfortable and information on what it will be like in NetCo or the estate is at a minimum, but I think we all decided honesty was best.GP  -----Original Message-----From: 	Johnson, Rick  Sent:	Thursday, December 20, 2001 1:57 PMTo:	Piper, Greg; Curless, Amanda; Jones, Robert W.- HR ExecCc:	Pieper, Kalen; Cash, MichelleSubject:	APPROVED Talking Points  - Estate employeesImportance:	HighMichelle and Greg s comments included - we  have approval to use the following talking points - Regards, Rj. Talking Points - ESTATE Employees ?	As communicated in the December 19 OOTC email, NETCO is what we are calling the company that will be used to re-build the North American gas and power business under different ownership?	You have been identified as an employee who will stay with the Enron estate.  You will not be transitioned to NETCO, once it is formed. ?	In your role, you will be asked to perform in the interest of the estate as we continue to operate our businesses, or, if appropriate, to sell, wind down and/or close out business activities.  These activities will continue according to the instructions and control of the bankruptcy process?	As you may know, the bankrupt estate is planning to propose a retention program and severance opportunities for employees who are critical to managing the estate.  A draft proposal has been submitted to the creditors committee for comments, and further details will be released as soon as we can provide them, which we hope will be in the coming days /weeks.  This plan will be separate from the NETCO proposals.  It is our intent to get details of this plan to you as quickly as possible?	This may create some uncertainty for you.  However, the work you do is important to the value imbedded in the estate and its many affiliate interests. We want you to continue doing your job in operating assets or working on the wind-down as the bankruptcy reorganization process runs its course ?	As certain wholesale functions and/or business purposes are eliminated, your employment may be terminated.  As I mentioned earlier, we have given a proposed severance policy to the creditors committee.  If that committee approves a proposal, the court then must approve it. There is typically recognition of the estate employees  commitments to the orderly reorganization and emergence of the bankrupt estate, however, there are no assurances available at this time ?	Be assured that we will advise you of developments as soon as they can be communicated accurately.  If you have any questions or concerns about your assignment, or your role relative to the NETCO deal closure, please address those immediately with your department head or HR representatives"

378049,2002-01-04 14:58:35,"Want to clarify if the Estate has the right to do a services deal with a 3r=d party with our copy of the licenses after the NetCo deal is done. =20=20Here is the issue (as per an old draft of the Assignment and License Agreem=ent).=20In the current deal, Enron assigns, sells, transfers and conveys to NetCo a=ll of the rights, title and interest in and to the software and intellectua=l property rights.  In other words, NetCo will be the owner of the Enron de=veloped applications or software including EOL, TAGG, ERMS, DCAF, Sitara, U=nify, EnPower, etc.  Enron or the estate gets back a worldwide, perpetual, =irrevocable, nonexclusive, fully paid-up, royalty free license of all of th=em for any purpose.  I am not sure why the original deal was done this way =as opposed to Enron continuing to own all the software and just granting a =perpetual, royalty free license to all the applications to NetCo, but I rea=lize we are in the 11th hour.=20What it also says is that Enron shall not have the right to grant any subli=cense to any third party for use within the field of ""wholesale trading of =natural gas and electricity within North America.""  It also says that NetCo= can t, as long as Enron owns 20% of NetCo, assign or license the software =to any third party or use the software for any of the prohibited commoditie=s.=20Is trading the act of buying and selling of the commodities?  Once a NetCo =deal is completed, we want to have NetCo and the estate agree that trading =is buying and selling, not service or fulfillment.  I would like the Estate= to maintain the right and ability to sub-license all the applications asso=ciated with logistics and settlement (not EOL or those systems associated w=ith buying and selling and order capture) to a third party that would have =the opportunity to build a mid and back office processing and service busin=ess around those sub-licenses in all commodities, including gas and power i=n North America.  The Estate may even outsource to this 3rd party and take =back a service agreement from this 3rd party as well as some of the future =profit it generates from this service company.

Delainey s NewCo will be interested in that since the document licenses back all the applications to Enron and its affiliates.  Also, if an affiliate becomes a 3rd party due to sell down or sale, we need the ability to continue the sub license to the 3rd parties.Second, section 2.2 says within 3 business days after Closing Date (as defined in Contribution Agreement) Assignor will deliver to Assignee one tangible copy of Source and Object Code and documentation.  I don t think that follows the plan to duplicate everything by the end of January or early February then get going our separate ways.  I am worried that Enron can t meet that 3 day demand since we are in a process together to copy everything.  Webb should comment on this.Also, we need the ability to license the non-EOL applications to a third party so they can use them to offer and build a service company around them, including gas and power logistics and settlement.  This 3rd party would not trade against NetCo but would offer mid and back office services to trading companies.  This would actually benefit NetCo since this entity could improves scheduling and settlements in the industry.  Existing NetCo management would understand this.Also, I think non-compete issues should be at the commercial level in the agreement, not the systems level so I would vote to remove in 3.1 (a) the language around sublicenses in the field of use with trading, etc. as we discussed today.  I am not sure what trading means for this or other documents.Finally, in section 4.4, what are the prohibited commodities?Thanks.GP-----Original Message-----From: Roger.Ross@weil.com [mailto:Roger.Ross@weil.com]Sent: Monday, January 07, 2002 1:51 PMTo: Piper, GregCc: ian.trumpower@weil.com; AMelville@weil.com; nancy.raber@weil.comSubject: template assignment and license agreementGreg:Here is a copy of the template assignment and license agreement.

378064,2002-01-07 13:27:36,"Looks like we have an issue with RisktRAC access.  In order to be able to set up books in RisktRAC, the only role that currently exists is the Risk Controls group, who has access to all books, hierarchies etc (all groups, all commodities).  With NetCo coming on line, the Risk Controls group has been asked to approve RisktRAC access to the new NetCo controls group so they can set up the new gas books that have been requested.  I am uncomfortable granting access to NetCo personnel, as they would be able to see all the estate info, including Europe, EIM, EGM, ENA etc.  Also, it is my understanding that the IT groups are working on splitting out the systems but will not be able to do so until after these books have to be set up (deadline for them is next Monday).  As such, I recommend the following: In order to ensure there is a segration between NetCo and the estate, until the systems are segregated, the IT groups should be responsible for setting up books, curves etc.How does that sound?ThanksShona WilsonDirector, Global Risk OperationsX39123"

Jay Webb, Anne Koehler and Bob McAuliffe and the bidder reps are going to try to finalize the discussions we had tonight in to a mutually agreeable transition services agreement.  We will, day one, have the list of IT assets (people, application hardware, Enron developed software) that will transfer.  We will need to finalize Jay s issue around NetCo contract employees related to 3rd party software until we can get that separated.  That will leave the service issues to network and data center. We didn t discuss this in the call with the bidder reps, but if the IP stays with the estate and a license goes to NetCo, the estate can t and won t write NetCo a 2 year call option on the IP so that they have 2 years to decide to call it away.  Take a license and move on and leave Enron the IP. What we did not discuss was what each party can use systems for, etc.  Both the above bidder and the other bidder have put in proposals that would restrict Enron from using the systems or applications for, in my opinion, any use in gas and power in North America, physical or financial, for any trading, market making, origination, marketing, etc. except for Unwinding Activities and in one bid, pipeline business as well. The estate or Enron would like the ability to use the applications and systems not only for the management or unwinding of positions and supporting the pipelines but would also need them for the NewCo or energy business that can grow out of some of the remains in the estate and the ability to sub license the mid and back office applications to a 3rd party that would not compete in trading or marketing, but would use them to build a service company around them that would service gas and power companies in North America.

Please give us information (Chris, Keith, Susie, Susan and me) information as you get it.  The first priority is the rolls supporting the DPR information.  Also, please remember that all information needs to be reconciled to DPR information.  Please let Chris, Keith & myself know of your time frame to get us this info.  Currently, expectations are that we should have at least the rolls by the end of the week this week. ThanksShona WilsonDirector, Global Risk OperationsX39123"
378183,2002-01-17 07:19:49,"Is everyone responding to you on this?  If not, who are you missing?  I talked to Hall, Perlman and Rub this morning and I assume Sweeney is easy since all his operations people are EIM and EGM.  Also, Apollo and Dayao are probably EES but confirm with them.  Get hem all to respond back to you directly.  This is also going to be very fluid.  For example, Hall has 43 names or so and we all know that probably and additional 60 or so will get put back to the estate off the UBS list if they go with their plan to take less not more.  Although all of Hall s folks are ENA, the actual names may change.  Also, Jenny Rub has about 100 employees remaining in infrastructure.  This would be desktop support, phones, the network, data centers, etc. and although some techs are dedicated to certain business units, the majority of her group will just support EWS/estate as a whole as they always have.  Her infrastructure group will therefore be shown to you as an org chart with what certain functions groups of people support.  Perlman is attempting to break out but she normally divides by commodity or application, like Unify which cuts across commodities.Do the best you can.Thanks.GP "

Is the risk control and deal approval process going to change? (B)3.	What percent of wholesale power and gas trading business does the top twenty counterparties represent? (B)4.	Has Enron been asked to raise the amount of collateral posted by any counterparties?  What is the aggregate amount? (B)5.	How is the credit downgrades expected to affect Enron s margin requirements?

How is the VAR model validated?  Is the model backtested?  If so, is it a theoretical backtest where positions are held fixed or an actual backtest where actual P&L is compared to the estimated VAR?  How many times last year did the back tested value exceed the VAR? (S)16.	What is the model vetting process?  Who is responsible for validating traders  models?

Dynegy is already on the Committee.    Important hearings in the PG&E bankruptcy are scheduled for December.   These hearings should begin to vet the issue of preemption, or the ability of the federal bankruptcy court to preempt state law under the bankruptcy code, thus freezing out the CPUC from ruling on the transfer of PG&E s generating assets to FERC jurisdiction. We continue settlement discussions PG & E.   Including offsets in our trading contracts, our net nominal exposure to PG&E is $511 million.    The claim is disputed primarily due to the pending FERC refund case.       In initial discussions, Enron offered a $85 million discount.    PG&E has countered with a $237 million discount, a $152 million gap.  We are meeting with the company in an attempt to narrow the difference.Southern California Edison (SCE) has broken off settlement negotiations.

380157,2001-11-15 07:18:47,"I have received questions about interpreting the ratio.   Let me use yesterday s closing price.   The merger probability is derived from a two scenario test, merger closure or merger non closure (there is also a competing offer scenario in reality).    Let s use a closing DYN price of $46.20 yesterday (note I had a typo), at the exchange ratio, (not taking into account timing and dividends), this yields a merged ENE price of $12.40 ($46.20 * .2685).   ENE closed at $10.00 yesterday.   Thus if the market thought there was complete certainty of merger, the prices would converge at $12.40.Now comes the artful part, the non merger ENE price.    I included another tab (Merger) to sensitize this.  Say we pick an ENE price with no merger of $4.00.   Looking at a deterministic probability, one can look at the distance (difference) in dollars to calculate the probability.  For instance:ENE merged           12.40ENE close 14-Nov   10.00ENE no merger         4.00Probability of merger = (1-((12.40-10.00) / (12.40 - 4.00))) or 71.4%.   Said another way, there is a 71.4% chance of being worth $12.40 and a 28.6% chance of being worth $4.00, which yields a weighted price of $10.00  ($12.40 * 71.4%)+($4.00 * 28.6%).I also included a $1 distressed ENE price and a $7 previously observed low end ENE price as scenarios.Regards,Michael"

380330,2001-12-09 15:33:51,"Steve I have validated the curve shift data against the official internal daily position and p&l reports (which report total p&l) and am generally comfortable with the original curve-shift numbers. The differences betweeen the two are due to the following components of profit and loss, i.e. those which price moves against a day s closing position do not capture: 1    Intra day positioning (in the forward and cash markets)2    New deals against our mid curve3    Liquidity and other reserve movements4    Liquidation (i.e. where forward mark-to-market value drops out of the forward book and into cash) The data set you have is the one we use to test the efficacy of our VaR models and I would be cautious in their use for predicting profitability. Hence total p&l is the best indicator since it includes all the value changes in the book.  I imagine you are using some measure of return on risk to predict p&l (RoVaR, for example). We have done similar studies for presentation to our Board, amongst others. Let me know if this analysis would be useful to you - we would be happy to provide it. RegardsDavid   "

380599,2002-01-25 05:16:40,"I would see the primary responsibilities:1. Develop with Fallon a written process for the valuation of terminated contracts.  We will most likely only have Bjorn for a short period of time given his reluctance to go to NETCO.  While no one appears to care about the fact that we have no way to render a correct value for financial statement purposes, this would be a priority if I was managing the estate.   There is no metric for the approval of comprises internally.  Our curves say one value, the counterparties quotes say another.  Differences in value may be a better metric that notional settlement amounts.2. With IT, assure that the terminated contracts are frozen in value.   The book is currently floating, rendering an open position which is unmeasured as to VaR.  Examine ways, if any, to manage this uncovered market risk. 3. Valuation of assets held for sale and DASH process.   It would appear that we should work backwards from the summary of sale that the Unsecured Creditors Committee wants.   There have already been complaints about multiple forms (DASH, transaction review committee for).  This would require revamping the DASH process and TAP.   4. Revaluation of International assets.5. To the extent EES performs post petition, value this book and the associated  ongoing costs associated with it.6. My understanding is that the billing on performing accounts is behind. Manage and develop a process to collect these past due amounts.  Collectibility does not improve with time.7. Ongoing review of business unit s cash requests.8. Develop a systematized IT solution to payments and transfers made 90 days prior to bankruptcy (in process).9. Manage the bankrupt counterparty portfolio.10. Collect amounts owed by PG&E and So Cal Edison ($545 million notional).11. Maintain a pipeline report."

He isunamused.4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer fromthe Alamodomemerchants. I share my beer with twohigh school girlssitting behind me. Surprisingly, theyare equippedwith a flask full of vodka.

As it turnsout, theAlamodome has a policy that no beer canbe sold whenthere is less than 10 minutes on thegame clock. I amenraged by this policy. I ask loudly:""Why the fuckdidn t you announce last call over thefucking PAsystem??!!""5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped inmy chair indefeat. All of a sudden, the Texascrowd goesabsolutely nuts. ""Whazzis?,"" I mutter,awaking frommy coma, ""Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?""Alas, theanswer is no, we were not winning andwe did notscore.The largest (by far) cheer of the dayfrom the Texasfaithful occurred when the handlerswere walking backto the tunnel and Bevo stopped to takea gargantuanshit all over the letters ""S"",""K"", and ""A"" in the""Nebraska"" spelled out in their endzone. I cheerwildly. I pick up the empty Travelerbottle and stickmy tongue in it. I am thirsty.6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk asI walk backto the truck. I would taunt them withsome off-colorremarks about their parentage, but I amtoo drunk toform complete sentences. With my lastcognitivethought of the evening, I take solacein the fact thatif we had not beaten them in October,they would beplaying Florida State for the nationalchampionship.6:30 Back in the car. On the way backto Austin forthe 8:00 Texas-Arizona tip off. We canstill salvagethe day! I crack open a beer. It iswarm. I don tcare.7:12 We have stopped for gas. I amhungry. I goinside the store. I walk past the beerfrig. Inotice a Zima. I ve never had a Zima. Iwonder ifit s any good. I pull a Zima from thefrig. I twistthe top off and drink the Zima in threeswallows.Zimasucks. I replace the empty bottle inthe frig.7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in thestore. I walk towhere the ingredients are, where theperson usuallymakes the sub. There is no one there. Ilean overthe counter and scoop out half a bucketof blackolives. I eat them. I am still hungry.I leanfurther over the counter and grabapproximately twopounds of Pastrami. I walk out of thestoregrunting and eating Pastrami. Thepatrons in thestore fear me. I don t care.8:01 We are in South Austin. I havebeen drinkingwarm beer and singing Brooks and Dunntunes for overan hour. My truck-mate is tired of mysinging. Hesuggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunnhave writtenother good songs besides ""You re Goingto Miss Me WhenI m Gone"" and ""Neon Moon"" and thatmaybe listening toonly those two songs, ten times eachwas a bitexcessive. Perhaps, he suggests, Icould just let theCD play on its own. I tell him tofuck off andrestart ""Neon Moon.""8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. Mytruckmate,against my loud and profaneprotestations, parks onthe top floor of a nearby parkinggarage. I tell himhe s an idiot. I tell him we will neverget out. Itell him we may as well pitch afucking tent here. Heignores me. I think he s still pissedabout theBrooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle ""NeonMoon"" loudly.8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beersstuffed inmy pants. We re going to kick theshit out ofArizona.9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona29. I ampleased. I go to the bathroom to peefor the 67thtime today. I giggle to myself becauseof thenew opportunity to do ""the bathroomBrice."" There areno Arizona fans in the bathroom. I amdisappointed.I tell myself (out loud) that I have a""Niiiiiicecock."" No one is amused but me.9:41 I walk to the bathroom whiledrinking Bud Lightout of a can. Needless to say, they donot sell beerat the Erwin Center, much less BudLight out of a can.I am stopped by an usher: ""Where didyou getthat, sir?"" I tell him (no shit):""Oh, thecheerleaders were throwing them up withthose littleplastic footballs. Would you mindthrowing this awayfor me?"" I take the last swig and handit to him. Heis confused. I pretend I m going to thebathroom, butI run away giggling instead. I duckinto someentrance to avoid the usher, who is nowpursuing me.I sneak into a large group of peopleand sit down.Theusher walks by harmlessly. I amgiggling like a littlegirl. I crack open another can of BudLight.9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoidthe usher, Ihave lost my bearings. I have no ticketstub. Icannot find my seats. Texas is losing.10:09 Texas is being screwed by therefs. I amenraged. I have cleared out the seatsaround mebecause I keep removing my hat andbeating thesurrounding chairs with it. A concernedfan asks ifI m OK and perhaps I shouldn t take itso seriously.I tell him to fuck off.10:15 After the fourth consecutive""worst fuckingcall I have EVER seen,"" I attempt toremove my hatagain to begin beating inanimateobjects. However, onthis occasion I miscalculate and Ithumbnail myself inmy left eyelid, leaving a one-quarterinch gash overmy eye. I am now bleeding into my lefteye and allover my shirt. ""Perhaps,"" I think tomyself, ""I mtaking this a bit seriously.""10:22 I am standing in the bathroompeeing. I m sodrunk I am swaying and grunting. I havea bloodynapkin pressed on my left eye. My pantsare bloody.I have my (formerly) white shirtwrapped around mywaist. I look like I should be in anepisode of Cops.10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloodywhite shirtback on my body and make my way for theexits. I amstopped every 20 seconds by a goodsamaritan/cop/security guard to ask mewhy I amcovered in blood, but I merely gruntincoherently andkeep moving.10:59 With my one good eye, I havelocated theparking garage.

Kurtis was almost finished, and wanted to get some fresh air, and decided to answer the call.  As he approached the check-out stand a distant smile caught his eye, the new check out girl was beautiful.  She was an older woman (maybe 26, and he was only 22) and he fell in love.Later that day, after his shift was over, he waited by the punch clock to find out her name.  She came into the break room, smiled softly at him and took her card and punched out, then left.  He looked at her card, BRENDA.  He walked out only to see her start walking upthe road.Next day, he waited outside as she left the supermarket, and offered her a ride home.  He lookedharmless enough, and she accepted.  When he dropped her off, he asked if maybe he could see heragain, outside of work.  She simply said it wasn t possible.  He pressed and she explained she hadtwo children and she couldn t afford a baby-sitter, so he offered to pay for the baby-sitter.Reluctantly she accepted his offer for a date for the following Saturday.That Saturday night he arrived at her door only to have her tell him that she was unable to go withhim.  The baby-sitter had called and canceled.  To which Kurtis simply said, ""Well, lets take thekids with us.""She tried to explain that taking the children was not an option, but again not taking no for ananswer, he pressed.  Finally Brenda, brought him inside to meet her children.  She had an olderdaughter who was just cute a bug, Kurtis thought, then Brenda brought out her son, in a wheelchair,he was born a paraplegic with down syndrome.  Kurtis asked Brenda, ""I still don t understand why thekids can t come with us?""  Brenda was amazed.  Most men would run away from a woman with two kids, especially if one had disabilities.  Just like her first husband and father of her children did.That evening Kurtis and Brenda loaded up the kids, went to dinner and the movies.  When her sonneeded anything Kurtis would take care of him.  When he needed to use the rest room, he picked himup out of his chair, took him, brought him back.  The kids loved Kurtis.  At the end of the evening,Brenda knew this was the man she was going to marry and spend the rest of her life with.A year later, they were married and Kurtis adopted both of her children and since they have added two morekids.So what happened to the stock boy and check out girl?Well, Mr. & Mrs. Kurt Warner, now live in St. Louis, where he is employed by the St. Louis Rams and plays quarterback."

We met with Bryan Murtagh (UBS attorney) and did an overview of the contract services we are looking to set up with the pipes, how those are utilized and some of the underlying risks/exposure of using these contracts. Basically the message was these are non-negotiable contracts, he seemed to understand that and didn t indicate this would require any major legal review from their side. We also had a discussion about the credit requirements and what some of the pipes are asking for. Follow up credit meeting to take place today to get into some greater detail and get a standard credit package together. Also UBS did indicate that they also want to do a credit review of the pipes before moving forward. To faciltiate that we gave them a list of the Day 1 pipes to start their process.In summary, I don t believe there will be any challenge on us entering into these agreements nor a lenghty review by the UBS attorneys. The credit issue is big, need to have them expedite their review of pipelines and also recognize our need to satisfy the pipeline credit requirments for a new customer (standard credit package and any addtional requirements). Also need some defintitive answers on when we can actually send this information out (is it now or is it when the deal closes). Suzanne is going to a legal meeting this AM to discuss/recap where everything is at this point in time. I will forward any additonal information to you when I get it.

391869,2001-11-26 09:16:21,"This is an alert that FERC will be more critical in the future of negotiated rate deals.  The orders discussed below dealt with buyout provisions in negotiated rate deals that Tennessee, ANR and Columbia had done.  These provisions had previously been permitted as negotiated rates, but FERC has decided that there is ""significant potential for undue discrimination"" and the recourse rates do not provide an adequate alternative.   Thus, anything in a negotiated rate deal that is not strictly rate-related will most likely be subject to intense scrutiny.FERC ADDS ANOTHER LAYER TO POLICY ON NEGOTIATED-RATE AUTHORITYActing on a series of contract-specific cases, FERC last week sharpened its policy on what is, and isnot, allowed under negotiated rates. In further defining its policy, the commission continued to leanheavily on the ""linchpin"" of negotiated-rate authority - that a customer not willing or able to negotiate adeal must always have the option of obtaining needed capacity under cost-based recourse rates.During discussion of the orders, Chairman Pat Wood III said it was ""important to keep in mind, as werush into the brave new world on the gas side,"" that ""all customers must be treated on a nondiscriminatorybasis by pipelines."" Last week s proclamation should be considered ""a reaffirmation of that nondiscriminatorytrend,"" he asserted.In representative language, the commission said it wants to ensure that parties ""are clear about contractingpractices that we find unacceptable because they present a significant potential for undue discrimination and thosethat we find acceptable because they can be permitted without substantial risk"" of such unequal treatment.FERC declared that a ""key factor"" in determining whether a negotiated provision is considered an""appropriate material deviation"" from a pipeline s filed tariff schedule is the extent to which recourse ratesprovide ""adequate alternatives"" to other shippers.In cases involving rates negotiated by ANR Pipeline Co. (GT01-25, RP99-301), Tennessee Gas PipelineCo. (RP96-312, et al.) and Columbia Gas Transmission Corp. (CP01-70), the commission ruled that thebuyout provisions are not allowed unless they are offered to all shippers as part of the pipelines  generallyavailable tariffs.The provisions at issue allow customers to buy out or terminate their contract demand levels prior tothe end of the deals. While the commission previously has held that such provisions can be included in anegotiated-rate package, ""we have reconsidered that holding"" because similar buyout opportunities arenot available to more traditional shippers operating under recourse rates, it said in the Tennessee order.Where a customer is seeking service for a set contract term and quantity, recourse service provides an""adequate alternative,"" the commission observed. ""However, if the customer desires a special contractdemand reduction or early termination right not provided in the generally applicable tariff, the availabilityof service at the recourse rate does not provide an adequate substitute, since recourse service would notinclude any such provision."" A shipper obtaining such a provision would be insulated from a certaindegree of risk, giving it ""an advantage over recourse-rate shippers,"" the commission pointed out.""A shipper s right to reduce, or terminate, its contract demand before the expiration of its contract is avaluable right, since it can enable the shipper to avoid significant liability for future reservation charges,""FERC said, adding that ""such a valuable right must be granted in a not unduly discriminatory manner.""Requiring pipelines to file generally applicable tariff provisions setting forth the conditions underwhich they will offer contract demand reduction rights ""is the best means of assuring that those rights willbe negotiated"" in a fair manner, FERC reasoned. Once approved, the tariff language ""will require thepipeline to grant similar rights to similarly situated customers.""Commissioner Linda Breathitt applauded the policy shift, characterizing it as a much-needed shot inthe arm for a program that had become ""muddled."" Through a ""tortured line of cases,"" FERC s definitionsof allowable contracting practices were ""obscured,"" Breathitt said in welcoming the new ""common-sense""approach. The ""tug of war"" that parties have engaged in over the past few years ""really hasn t served ourobjective of ensuring that nondiscriminatory rates and service"" are available to all shippers, she said."

391981,2002-02-04 13:47:02,"X-FileName: hunter shively 6-26-02.PSTWe are continuing work to ensure our new online trading system, UBSWenergy, is ready for launch on the week of Feb. 11, which is the week following the anticipated Enron/UBS Closing Date of Friday, Feb. 8.To assist in this process, we are planning an online trading simulation for Thursday, February 7 from  0900 to 1100 (CST). It is planned to include all  traders, originators, mid/back-office staff and IT teams who would normally be involved with electronic trading.Purpose of the simulation - The simulation will test our ""live"" trading environment (restricted to internal access only) and will:Test the integrity and functionality of the system and related processes (including credit, risk, legal, operations, etc.)Provide an opportunity for traders to verify their products and product setupDemonstrate how the trading system and processes work to UBS staff visiting next weekNature of the simulation - The simulation will include testing of all processes related to trading and mid/back-office functions:Credit, Legal, Risk, Operations, and other groups:Profile tests for ""external"" customers (role-played by Originators)Profile tests for internal users (traders, back-office, etc.)Data and Process checking as completed transactions flow through Mid/back-Office systemsTraders and Originators:Traders will be managing their individual books and associated products. Although we may be restricted to certain financial products on launch day, both physical and financial will be available during the simulation. Each trader will be asked to manage their individual position and profitability goals for the simulation.Originators and others will be asked to play the roles of counterparties. Credit limits, etc. will be tested during the simulation.Information Technology:Will assist in preparing data on the system for the simulation.After the simulation is over, will work with the relevant groups to test the trade-data in various systems and risk booksWill ensure all simulation data is removed from the system after the simulation is complete.Next steps Traders and Originators will be contacted prior to simulation day to ensure they have appropriate access to the system.Originators will be assigned specific roles. You should expect to receive an email and/or handout on or before Wednesday, Feb. 6.UBSWenergy personnel will be meeting with back office personnel over the next several days to ensure everything is in place for the simulation.SummaryThis simulation is an important step towards re-launching our trading business. We appreciate the participation of everyone involved as we prepare for the public launch of UBS Warburg Energy and the UBSWenergy trading platform.If you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or ideas regarding this simulation, please feel free to contact Bob Shults (30397) or myself (31861).

The comments support the NOPR except that we say the FERC should make it absolutely clear that the intraday recall right must be part of a specific and express agreement between the releasing and replacement shipper, and that FERC should schedule a workshop after issuing the order so that operational concerns, such as accounting and gas tracking issues, can be worked out.Comments must be filed by Monday, so please let me know if you have any concerns or suggestions by noon CST on Friday, 11/16.

During the summer, FERC initiated an investigation into the potential of unjust and unreasonable spot prices in the northwest from December of 2000 through June of 2001.  Seatlle City Light, Tacoma City Light, Eugene Water and Electric Board, and Sacramento Municipal Utility District all filed claims at FERC for refunds from EPMI.  The claims totaled close to $100 million.  However, many of these claims were, on their face, spurious.  For example, Eugene Water and Electric Board filed for refund of forward purchases which was clearly outside the scope of FERC s proceeding.We hired consultants from Charles River Associates (CRA) to help us with this process.  One of their tasks was to apply the CAISO competitive benchmark pricing methodology to the Northwest market.  That is, CRA attempted to reverse engineer the CAISO s methodology in order to estimate our Northwest risk.I was informed by our litigation team that EPMI s realistic potential exposure using this methodology was roughly $30 million.  We decided to reserve roughly 2/3 of this amount which came to about $21 million.In September a FERC Adminitrative Law Judge heard the case and submitted a draft decision to the FERC.  The draft decision recommended against any refunds.  This draft decision is supposed to come in front of the FERC commissioners for approval before the end of the year.  If this draft decision is approved, it would be appropriate to remove these reserves."
402233,2001-11-08 19:13:45,"X-FileName:  Dynegy-Enron Deal Faces Significant Reg ReviewBy Bryan Lee  11/08/2001 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES    WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- Any merger deal that may emerge between Dynegy Inc. (DYN) and Enron Corp. (ENE) will face a complicated and time-consuming regulatory-review process, legal experts said Thursday.Any equity deal would require approvals from numerous U.S. federal regulatory agencies and state utility regulators, as well as survive Canadian and European antitrust reviews, energy attorneys contacted by Dow Jones Newswires said. A merger would require approvals from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Securities and Exchange Commission, Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission. And the Illinois Commerce Commission likely would weigh into the mix, since Dynegy owns Illinova s Illinois Power Co. Any effort to strike a deal quickly also could be complicated by Enron s ownership of Portland General Electric Co. While Enron has entered into an agreement to sell the utility to Northwest Natural Gas Co. (NWN), a previous attempt to sell the company fell through because of regulatory complications. A key issue for federal regulators scrutinizing a potential Enron-Dynegy merger will be the degree of electricity market concentration such a transaction would entail, the attorneys said. Financially wounded Enron is the nation s largest electricity and natural gas trader with an extensive network of gas pipelines. Dynegy is ranked sixth nationally in both electricity and natural gas marketing. The transaction would receive the greatest scrutiny at FERC, where the merger application would challenge the commission s merger-review policy, attorneys said.         Racing Against The Liquidity Clock    ""Enron is a complicated beast,"" and an acquisition by Dynegy likely would ""stretch FERC s limits of market-power review,"" one legal expert said. The primary question the commission will consider is whether combining the companies will increase market concentration in wholesale power markets to an unacceptable level. Also, FERC is in the process of changing the basis upon which it authorizes electricity sales at market-based rates, which could pose complications for a combined Enron-Dynegy down the road. According to Platts Power Markets Week, Enron s market share in competitive power markets is nearly 15%, while Dynegy s is pushing 5%. That makes the combined market share perilously close to the 20% threshold of concern under antitrust review. But FERC will undertake a more complicated analysis than that, looking at both vertical and horizontal market power, attorneys said. On a horizontal basis, there likely won t be much concern at FERC. Enron owns few hard generating assets compared to Dynegy, although FERC will scrutinize generation assets that Enron doesn t own but controls the output of on a contractual basis. It is in the vertical market power analysis where FERC s merger review gets truly complicated. The commission will assess to what degree the combination of Enron s pipelines - including one that controls 23% of natural gas imported from Canada - and Dynegy s portfolio of electric generation assets present competitive concerns. While Dynegy s pipeline holdings are far smaller than Enron s, it does have some upstream natural gas processing and gathering assets that FERC could view as problematic. Never before has FERC encountered a vertical market power analysis of such scale and scope before, legal experts agreed. Another aspect of the deal that will interest FERC, according to one attorney, is Enron s Internet-based trading platform, EnronOnline, through which 25% of wholesale power sales are traded. FERC has traditionally only looked at hard assets, but in recent weeks has indicated it intends to take a harder look at financial assets when considering market power issues. But even if FERC doesn t take on the issue, the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission certainly will when considering the antitrust aspects of the combination. ""These two companies are huge commodity traders. Oftentimes they re trading in commodities that have nothing to do with energy,"" noted one attorney. Antitrust agencies will scrutinize whether the combination could present market power concerns for nonenergy-related commodities as well as electricity and natural gas. As if the complicated market-power reviews by FERC and antitrust agencies weren t enough, the deal also must pass muster at the Securities and Exchange Commission under the 1935 Public Utility Holding Company Act. The Depression-era law restricts the geographic scope and nonenergy business holdings of multistate utility holding companies. Dynegy is an exempt holding company under the act, since its utility holding is confined to one state. It would have to register under the law and potentially divest assets to garner SEC approval as long as Enron still holds Portland General Electric, attorneys agreed. The SEC review also is complicated by the 26% stake in Dynegy held by ChevronTexaco (CVX). That investment was structured in a highly complex manner to avoid triggering regulation under the 1935 holding company act, according to a lawyer familiar with the deal. Dynegy could structure the deal in several different ways in order to sidestep holding company act restrictions, according to a leading legal expert on the law. Dynegy could take nonvoting or preferred stock with conversion rights contingent on Enron s selling the Oregon utility, the attorney said. ""There are ways to structure it short of a stock-for-stock deal, which is what most people think about."" Given the race against the clock driven by Enron s increasingly perilous liquidity crunch, such an investment sidestepping regulatory review may be the way the companies have to go in the near term. ""It s a run on the bank,"" the holding company act expert said. A Wall Street analyst suggested that, given Enron s predominance in energy markets, concerned Washington regulators and politicians may choose to expedite the deal. ""Enron going down on the verge of winter is not a good thing,"" the analyst said. ""They may be more lenient if they can put a frigging tourniquet on Enron.""    -By Bryan Lee, Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-6647; Bryan.Lee@dowjones.com   Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

In connection with this transmission agreement, abusiness decision needs to be made as to whether EPMI can realize valuefrom it.  That depends on what EPMI s long term needs for the transmissionare?  It is very risky to assume a 13.5 year deal if EPMI only needs thetransmission for the next year because once EPMI assumes the contract, allpayment obligations under that contract are postpetition, administrativeclaims.If EPMI can find a good buyer for this contract, the EPMI can assume andassign the contract and realize the value through the consideration paid bythe buyer for the contract.I understand that PGE may want us to assume or reject promptly, but withthis kind of contract, we need sufficient time to allow the business planto be fully developed and a firm understanding of what EPMI s long termneeds are going to be.I hope this helps.

He said that EPMI needs to make sure that it only pays thepost-petition part of the Dec transmission services invoice (received byEPMI on 1/2/02).  Apparently, this bill had Dec 1-2 (pre-petition)separated.  I understand that Steve Thome is retrieving the bill to makesure that EPMI pays only the post-petition amount (bill is in line to bepaid this Friday).Rich understands that EPMI is not going to pay the pre-petition at thistime and said that PGE is not planning to curtail EPMI s transmission.However, he asked that EPMI consider accepting or rejecting thetransmission agreement in bankruptcy court fairly soon.  MELANIE -- Can youplease let us know what to do in this regard?  This is a Long Term (13.5years remaining) electric transmission agreement with an estimated in themoney value to EPMI of $5 mill.

402856,2001-12-19 20:58:18,"X-FileName: Confidential:  For Internal Distribution OnlyThe purpose of this e-mail is to bring everyone in the loop on activities on the west desk that we are undertaking to preserve as much value in our book as possible.  I realize that our efforts to date have not been communicated to all internal people who need to know what we are doing.  My apologies for this.  Hopefully this e-mail will accomplish that goal.A number of counterparties in the west have not yet terminated our deals and have benefited from our inability to procure power in the market to serve these deals.  As a result, we haven t been delivering on several contracts that are deep in the money.  Our counterparties have no motivation to terminate our contracts because such a termination would force them to write us a substantial check.  Instead, these counterparties have been happy to not receive high priced power from us and are filling their positions in the market at much lower prices.We have taken the limited supplies that we are still receiving and delivering these limited supplies to the highest price sales contracts that we have.  We now have the ability to prepay for additional supplies in order to fulfill additional pre-petition obligations that have not yet been terminated that are in the money.  We have received approval from the Cash committee for purchases through December 27th (I think) and we will secure additional cash to continue on.Here are the procedures as I understand them.  If you have any questions or modifications please me an e-mail or give me a call.Cash DeskEach cash desk needs to identify all transactions in its region that have not been terminated.On a counterparty by delivery point basis we need to assess whether the weighted average of all near term (next day to next week) deliveries with that counterparty are in the money.If the average of all transactions with that counterparty at a given location are in the money, we should submit a request for and endeavor to serve the entire portfolio of deals with that counterparty at that delivery point.  We are of the opinion now that we will not be able to cherry pick deals with one counterparty at the same location.The cash desks should prepare a two week view of the positions that we will need to fill and an estimate (based on spot market prices) of the cash that we will need to serve these transactions to Steve Thome.The cash desk should provide a daily list of prepay deals that have been done to John Postlethwaite via e-mail.The cahs desk should provide a list of all historic prepays done so far to bring John current.Marketing DeskSteve Thome will coordinate the cash approval process for the west desk.The marketing desk is responsible for lining up counterparties who will be willing to supply us on a prepay basis.The marketing desk should direct any legal questions from sellers to Steve Hall/Christian Yoder.Make sure that sellers fax a copy of the confirmation letter to Steve Hall/Christian Yoder at (503) 464-8058.The marketing desk needs to work with the cash desk to buy power on a spot basis.  We don t necessarily care who buys it, but rather, we want to ensure that we receive the best price and that all purchases are communicated.Whoever secures a supply needs to communicate the need for cash to Steve Thome.Deal EntryThe new deals need to be entered in a manner that will be possible to settle.  After discussing the matter with Stacey White, she recommended entering the new deals in Enpower as zero price, non MTM, with an annuity equal to the prepay amount.We should enter notes into Enpower indicating that these are prepay transactions.This will allow settlements to match an annuity in Enpower with prepay out the door.  It will also prevent them from paying the counterparty twice.I m sure that I ve missed something.  Let me know.Regards,Tim"
