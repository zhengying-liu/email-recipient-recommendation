This is the <a href="https://inclass.kaggle.com/c/master-data-science-mva-data-competition-2017">data challenge</a> for the course "Advanced Machine Learning for Graph and Text" in the Master Data Science program of Universit√© Paris-Saclay.

In this challenge, we are asked to develop such a system, which, given the content and the date of a message, recommends a list of 10 recipients ranked by decreasing order of relevance.

Our team consists of four promising master students: Chia-Man, Mario, Salma and Zhengying.

We name our team "450euros", which is accidentally the amount of prize that will be awarded to the winning team.
